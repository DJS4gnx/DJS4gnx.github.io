        I first signed up for ROBLOX in 2014, basically being too young to think for myself but old enough to tell people that I don't like the taste of something. At least, whatever is after that during mid to late elementary. That account is history and I still have it on me, but there's another account. One that's currently lost.<br><br>
        
        In October 2018, I registered a fresh ROBLOX account. I'm not willing to share it's username or any big details, but you're free to privately pursue if you'd like. But the account marked a time for me that was both pretty horrendous to look back on, but also very endearing? It's a little over the place, but hear me out.<br><br>
        
        During the period of 2019, I had an obsession (and a bit of a grind) with the ROBLOX Roleplaying game RoCitizens, where I became pretty active and was actually pretty social. It was a place I often went to grind for the money, and then the house money glitch happened... And that was patched. :P<br><br>
        
        It was a great time. I had some petty wars with some people, but I had a lot of people with me. I often roleplayed in groups with lots of people, and for the first two to three quarters of 2019, I actually had a lot of fun! Aside from all the chaos and some of the occasional exploiters that I'd rush to leave in case they could take my account, of course. My music taste then was pretty edgy, and I was a bit of a cringelord, but it was a great time to be online despite some of the caveats in my life. I know I have the rose tinted shades on, but sometimes you just have to ignore the bad to remember the great you had.<br><br>
        
        Though it fell apart. People changed for the worst and a lot of people simply just stopped playing. It became harder to find roleplayers as it seemed they either moved to private spaces or just stopped playing at all. One of the people in on my old group also became my ex after doing some pretty strange things that I'd honestly like to not talk about. People just moved away, and I begun to miss what it was like. And with the reworked map in 2020, that was the nail in the coffin for my favorite RP game. I left and turned to other games. Had some shit experiences, and here I am.</p>
        
        <p>I miss a lot of what I got to experience, but that's another story.<br>
            This story was on a different account than the one I use now.</p>
            
            <p>I gave the account away to a friend and when I tried to get it off them, we couldn't figure out the pin. I tried every pin I remember setting and it didn't work. So we kind of just gave up and went back to where we were.</p>
            
            <p>ROBLOX removed those pins now. It's sour and I feel exposed to hackers, sure, but I've sucked it up. I added more auth to my account. And I'm just praying it works. But the thing is, those pins are gone. I could try again. But I didn't have contact with my friend, so today I have to rush and see if he's still active on the single email I know he's on.</p>
            
            <p>Here's to hoping I can get the account my nostalgic journey started on, I guess. 2019 was almost 5 years ago... Jesus.</p>
            <p><small>May 2025 Dj here: The account was recovered a week or two after the original post date :3</small></p>
