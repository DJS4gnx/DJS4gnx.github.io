    <title>Things to do when bored</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>backported from spacehey blogs</small></p>
<p>There are a lot of jokes in Things to Do When Bored, some are personal but a lot are just one off jokes that need to be explained, so that's what this post is for.</p>
<details>
<summary>Spoilers for the post!</summary>
"Rewrite an old joke you lost the script to" - This has a couple of meanings.<br>1. The idea of the blog post comes from a joke I cannot find anymore. If I was to try and find the original source, I would have to search through thousands upon thousands of files to read old chat archives. The script is literally lost.<br>2. Later on, this joke is rewritten. It was "lost" in the list of jokes.<p></p><p>"Tell Kam "Why did you make this"" - The original version of this line is repeated later on. Also, it adds to the below.<br><br>"Tell Kam "Why did you make this again"" - Following 'Rewrite an old joke', this is the second time this was ever done. Also adds to the below.<br><br>"Tell Kam that one day they will experience Karma for telling bad jokes" - All jokes in this blog are bad. Insert "Fuck you" here.</p><p>"Tell a repetition joke" - This blog features many jokes that involve telling it several times with only slight changes. Hence, it's a repetition joke. Tell a repetition joke.</p><p>"Use a Volcano as a Trash Can" - The original version of this joke involves potty humor, so this is a rewrite. <br>What if you could burn your trash?</p><p>"Make up a fact about an object that doesn't exist" - This is one of few jokes that don't have a joke attached to them. Interpret it however you'd like.</p><p>"Listen to Ryan Willen" - You remember how much I like Ryan Willen, right?</p><p>"Tell the same joke 3 paces later" - This joke also has several layers.<br>1. This was already told to somebody else prior to writing this blog. This is meta, but it counts.<br>2. The "Listen to" joke is told exactly 3 jokes later. The "kam106" and "wait a minute" joke can both be considered 3 paces later, although this was unintentional math on my part.<br>3. Some jokes are repeated 3 jokes later, way later on.</p><p>"Break up a good repetition joke with a very boring joke" - This can be interpreted as "The last joke breaks up the Listen to joke" or "This breaks up a good joke".</p><p>"Listen to kam106" - One of the two possible "three paces later" joke. Also, I wonder who that is.</p><p>"Listen to- wait a minute!" - The intended delivery for the "three paces later" joke. The person realizes they're 3 paces in.</p><p>"Tell the same joke 4 paces- wait a minute!" - This adds to the three paces joke, with another instance of the same joke. We have now told the same joke 3 AND 4 paces ahead.</p><p>"Say "Wait a minute" when nobody starts laughing" - Extension of above, the "wait a minute" joke has happened 3 lines in a row.</p><p>"Fool your friends three times" - Fool your friends three times in a row. The joke below explains this one.</p><p>"Fool your friends three times" - The above assumes your friend was fooled once. By making them read the same thing twice, you fooled them a second time. Adds to below.<br></p><p>"Fool your friends twice" - You changed it up, fooling them a third time. They think they were only fooled twice, but don't listen to them.</p><p>"Get in a situation where you have to explain the joke above" - When I told this joke to LS, it was explained to them. Therefore, I got in a situation where it had to be explained.</p><p>"Invent a method to fire a gun's barrel like a bullet" - This is a reference to a deranged idea I came up with, where clicking the trigger once on a made up pistol once fires a bullet, and clicking the trigger twice shoots the barrel.<br><br>"Oversimplification: The blog post is about a bunch of things you should probably not do" - This is explained near the end.<br><br>"Use a satire blog as a secret way to bottle up your feelings and subtly tell people you're too afraid to speak your mind" - This line is satire in itself. This did not happen.</p><p>"Look at spectrograms for fun" - Repetition joke for below.<br></p><p>"Look at cover art for fun" - Repetition joke for below.</p><p>"Look at the state of your brain that's forgetting what joke you were just thinking of (LOL!)" - Third part for the joke was forgotten.</p><p>"Tell a &lt;head&gt; joke" - Setup for the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke.</p><p>"Tell a &lt;body&gt; joke" - Setup for the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke.</p><p>"Combine the &lt;head&gt; joke and the &lt;body&gt; joke" - Create the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke so it can be told.</p><p>"Completely miss the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke" - The joke fell under confused ears.</p><p>"Write the worst satire blog ever made" - Guess what you just read.</p><p>"Get SpaceHey famous" - This is based on a real thing where my friend Sky supposedly made me "SpaceHey famous". It's a nice nod to that.</p><p>"Make unnecessary references to your life situations" - References above, as well as the "Rewrite an old joke" line.</p><p>"Rip your newest blog idea from the SCP Wiki" - This joke is a satire of the original "The Things Dr. Bright Is Not Allowed To Do" list. Well, formatted in that way.<br></p><p>"Replace one of your OCs with a nearly identical clone with a different name and face and pretend that OC had controversy" - Playing on the above, an OC being replaced because of controversy. Like Dr. Bright and Dr. Shaw.</p><p>"Accidentally discover a real scenario of the above" - Dr. Bright being replaced.</p><p>"Have a nightmare about houses" - Satire joke that adds to the "Unnecessary references" joke in a very satirical way.</p><p>"Make people play two truths one lie with a satire blog post" - Adding to the above, make people guess what's right and what's wrong.</p><p>"Obsess over satire blog posts" - The entire post was satire. Obsession over satire blogs here.</p><p>"Reformat an older joke you forgot how it went" - This adds to the opening joke, which was reformatted because the script was "lost" in the sea of other jokes.<br></p><p>"Oversimplify a bunch of jokes" - An earlier line oversimplified the blog topic.</p><p>"Successfully concern one of your fans with an accidental thought leak" - Direct hit at Kanye West specifically.</p><p>"Successfully concern one of your friends with an accidental blog leak" - Blog post was accidently leaked when I took a screenshot, somebody said they were concerned about what the blog was about. Accidental blog leak concerned somebody.</p><p>"Create over 40 unfunny jokes" - Up to this point, there was 43 lines. Over 40 jokes.</p><p>"Tell Kam "this is awful why did you make this"" - Repeated joke from the beginning. A repetition joke.<br></p></details><p></p>]]>

    <title>The Server Hunting Problem: Reddit's Inconsistency</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>backported from spacehey blogs</small></p>
<p>This is kind of a more personal rant of mine. While this rant is a little more heavier than usual, focusing a lot on chain reaction and overreactions, and a lot of other kinds of reactions... Obviously. But this rant is still a light hearted rant at it's core, despite how dramatic and overbearing it might be to some. I only want to goof off, after all.<br><br>But I genuinely have a love-hate relationship with searching for Minecraft Server ads on Reddit. So... Let's talk about it.</p><h1>Back to Stonewall</h1><div>For a brief moment, let's go back to the stone ages. The Stonewall of finding Minecraft Servers, if you will.</div><div><br></div><div>Long before the dawn of time... Before I was entirely aware of my actions, before I even knew what Myspace was... Before I got my annoying, booming personality. Back when the internet was more simple, ads were less extreme, and Google's power? Slightly less intense, when people didn't bat eyes as much.</div><div><br></div><div>Back then, servers used to be formatted in neat little lists, as far as I remember. Of course this is when I was young as shit, and didn't know where to find servers, so take my words with a grain of salt. There would be websites where people would flock to, you're given the server, you drop by, you have fun. That's that.</div><div><br></div><div>These server lists were cool, sure, but they were very primitive. Even now, they were made to fight for the top. Either you throw a bunch of money to get to the top or accept that most people won't click past the first page of the damn website. Yes, this is inevitable. If you don't believe me, count the times you ever had to use the second page of google on more than one hand.</div><div><br></div><div>Well, eventually those servers became garbage, people got bored of visiting the same types of servers, and well... Not many of them really focus on community. It's not like a nicely organized survival world where people can drop by and talk like people, right?<br><br>And that's where Hermitcraft comes in. With Reddit right behind it.</div><h1>Hope in the Castle<br></h1><div>I never actually watched Hermitcraft, so I can't actually say if it was good, if it was bad, or if it was... You know, literally anything or not. So I'll leave the comments to tell people about that.</div><div>Yes, I am aware of the existence of Lifesteal, and QSMP, I see you over there. But Hermitcraft is what influences a lot of Reddit based SMPs, so we're choosing to talk about that instead.</div><div><br></div><div>But as far as I can tell, it's like a co-operation heaven. There's shops run by diamonds, a whole welcoming community of friends that are all close, and best yet? Some trust among the people! It's a nice secluded place with a group of people who know eachother so well, trusting their own shops, making amazing buildings, and even making interesting conflicts in the world.<br><br>Okay, so what happens when a bunch of strangers you barely know make it?<br>You get the "Reddit Minecraft server community", a nickname I have given.</div><div><br></div><h1>An Orange Future</h1><div>And that's where the rant part comes in.</div><h2>Placebo for Desperates</h2><div>If you are unaware, Reddit has over the past four years gathered a mini community of subreddits dedicated to advertising Minecraft servers. If you are not already aware of some of them, some of these include r/MCServers for server ad postings, r/MinecraftServerFinder for both advertisers and users, and r/MinecraftBuddies for mainly users. We will be talking about MinecraftBuddies mainly as this is my subreddit of choice when it comes to searching.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, this is a rant. Sorry if you were mesermized by the retrospective from earlier, I was too, but we need to get angrier.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>For many people, what they're looking for in a Minecraft server changes. A lot. And it can be especially hard to explain what they're looking for when they forget the details every once and a while. And you especially get the frustration when people don't read.</div><div><br></div><div>Seriously, it's amazing.</div><div>Oh wait, we're not at that point yet. Let's rewind for a second.<br>Hey wait can we do it without the excessive header-<br></div><h2>Crafting the ad<br></h2><div>Okay, let's try this again.<br>While Reddit might seam like a wonderful tool for finding servers, you have to remember that you're basically advertising yourself to server owners. At least, that's what it's like where I'm from. So if you like the simple part of just having a new server fly on your face while you grab the ad and say "Oh my god, my calling has come to me!", you're wrong. Here's how it actually is.</div><div><br></div><div>First off you have to literally write out what you're looking for. In other words, basically crafting your own ads. Start with your age, because for one, who doesn't already share their age, and for two, because apparently some servers only allow people who are over 18 and over 16. Yes, those things exist. Because somebody in the Minecraft server community decided "Hey, this should be a meta!".</div><div><br></div><div>Now that you have your age and a basic intro paragraph (the part nobody cares about), you have to actually explain the shit you want. Be it a bunch of fighting people, some exploring, or even something basic. But don't get yourself too caught up, because this is where things kind of begin to fall apart.</div><div><br></div><div>You probably expected a simple game, didn't you? To finally easily find the server you want, and only the people who think they know you drop by, giving you servers you specify... You sure want that simple, vanilla server, with nothing but TPA, huh? Well fuck you, because you're getting Towny and Factions and you'll like it.</div><h2>The "MinecraftBuddies" Effect<br></h2><div>This is a strange trend I've noticed a lot with these kind of things. You list out in detail that you don't like factions because it's all about fighting and it's an RPG thing and you don't like the conflict it makes, then bam, come join our factions heavy server. This has happened nearly consistently in my own experience, and the fact that this happens basically almost EVERY time I'm searching for a server is fucking crazy.</div><div><br></div><div>You could be a mindless zombie, sure. You can stick to scrolling the server lists, but in the end, most of the things you see will just be ass and you won't like any of it. So instead of scrolling servers you usually don't like (at least in my case), you resort to letting people come to you and instead of getting better luck, people spit on you by ignoring half of your post.</div><div><br></div><div>Seriously, it does not take any effort to read I don't want FACTIONS of all things. What, am I being recommended Factions because I mentioned it once? Do people really miss the "I'm not looking for" part next to factions? Really?</div><div><br></div><div>Okay cool, so that part doesn't matter. So you write something dumb like "Only looking for Vanilla servers". Okay cool, you got your age, you got a short introduction, you got written what you're looking for. But uh oh, school's coming up soon and almost every teacher at your school will surely love giving you homework!</div><div><br></div><div>And then surprise, you'll have to do it all again, because little Timmy over there wants you to join his server, but then you have to be active 24/7 to stay. Yeah, real thing, wouldn't you love being active more than 3 hours for 5 days a week on Timmy's server like you're working a part time, right?</div><div><br></div><h2>More than Mildly Frustrating</h2><div>Didn't have enough yet? Let's talk about the underwelming. Assume your ad is done.<br></div><div><br></div><div>How about you start with the people who tell you basically nothing? They just leave a simple comment "DM me for more" and you find out it's over three paces opposite of what you actually wanted. This is even more frustrating than the people who just plainly disrespect what you're looking for because they hype you up just to kick you between the legs. Gee, thanks a lot for keeping my best interests in mind.</div><div><br></div><div>Not to mention the people who just tell you a bunch of shit about the server then tell you to add them yourself. Jesus, my discord tag is right there! You can read "@ kam106" on the fucking post, surely? Add me, don't just drop your tag and make me do it!</div><div><br></div><div>Plus to mention some of the time the other person has no fucking clue. Sometimes you have to notify them of the past three days as a reminder of why you're adding them and you have to end it off like "And then you left a comment on my post here:". Once I did all of that and the person literally had no clue what I was talking about. I had to hold in many urges to lash out at the dude to get his community together and get them to stop sending new members to you since they're making me doing shit like this just to have the guy go "iunno what you're on about", like is this a joke?</div><div><br></div><h2>The Fight for Satisfaction</h2><div>While we're at it, when you have such specific taste, it's nothing but a huge fight for even one good server, and the whole place is on fire. When people ask how your search is going, it's always like "My world's on fire! How about yours?" ah shit i made a smash mouth joke-</div><div><br></div><div>Forget about that! The search is always a pain in the ass. You specify you want Vanilla and people come to you with modded servers. You specify you want modded servers, and you get servers modded to hell and back. You specify you want light servers? Nope, not a market for it. And if you specify you want something normal to play for once, you hear royal sirens in the distance and a guy yelling "I HOPE YOU LIKE SEASONS!".</div><div><br></div><div>I am genuinely just appalled by ad searching. If you search, you mostly get junk you don't want. If you put out an ad saying you're looking, you mostly get junk you don't want. Everybody's trying to sell you on this whole grand server idea, and sometimes you even get the same person over five fucking times who doesn't fucking learn when you don't interact with their comment on the past three fucking posts you've made.</div><div><br></div><div>I might sound really angry about this, and that might be because I am, but I have to keep going because I've experienced most tricks under the sun by now and I must have gone through thousands of comments. Do you want to guess how many servers I actually enjoyed? Three.<br><br>The first server was modded and died out weeks after I joined.<br><br>The second server I barely play and I'm too nervous to interact with the community of.<br><br>The third server I had to quit because the buddy I was playing with got bored.</div><div><br></div><div>Literally everything in-between is filler. Mostly crazy people running amuck. I'm only in the second server now. The first server, I stopped talking to the guy. I also met another guy and I ended up having a few disagreements with him. Everything else either has too many people, isn't justifiable enough to play on, makes it very overbearing to try and interact with people, or I'm just too fucking nervous to try and interact with people. Why do you think I get nervous deciding if I accept people on SpaceHey?</div><div><br></div><div>I can blame this on being nervous all I want. You still have to hold accountable the fact that a lot of servers you try are just...</div><div><br></div><div>They're shit.</div><div>That's what it is.</div><div><br></div><div>Blog over.<br></div>]]>

    <title>The Switch from Spotify: foobar2000 + the many players out there</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p>This blog post is intended for nerds but if you're not a nerd, you're also free to join some nerds in the circle! I am no professional at explaining anything under the sun, but we're going to try our best and make something sound sensible.<br><br>When the pandemic started to die down around 2021, I learnt about and decided to switch to the long standing music player foobar2000 after learning about it through discord. I got the 32-bit version as it's all I saw, and immediately I got to work and started using the shit out of the player.<br><br>I would switch players often, as I always did. I had used AIMP and sometimes WinAmp the year prior, having used those all my life. I did also find myself interested in the windows bundled app windows media player 12 (as included with windows 7 and up, now unfortunately replaced with whatever wmp11 is) for all of those windows addicts and fruitiger aero people, but as cool as the player was, it wasn't practical. So I had to turn elsewhere.<br><br>First, let's tackle the elephant in the room, and the one everybody's going to get Nostalgic over. I hate to ruin everybody's fun but I do have a few things to say. Windows Media Player 12, first bundled with Windows 7, and continued to be bundled with Windows up until late versions of Windows 11, when it was replaced. <br>We'll drift into positives first: Simplicity. WMP12 made it very simple to handle audio, it was my first exposure to auto-scaling media library features and even my first exposure to genre tags and file tagging as a whole. I had lots of fun messing with it, learning the ins and outs, even messing around with the feature that would fix album art for songs that had it missing. It was a blast.</p><p>And then I grew up. I realized how much easier it was to fight with the player as I got older, how features begun to break and how I was no longer enjoying the player, and moreso fighting with it for control. Album art fetching broke, I started to fight with the tag system, I became unsatisfied. And then I left. Remembering how I would sometimes use AIMP on the side, I hopped ships.<br><br>AIMP was all fun, but it got boring fast. It had a nice UI and the plugins were awesome! The wallpapers would be nice additions too, especially the older 2009 wallpapers. But it always felt there was something missing sometimes, it played and did what it was meant to, but something left me wanting more.<br><br>WinAmp seemed to fill that hole for a while longer. Even though I used it later than I did AIMP, around ~2020, it had felt like a more old-school version of AIMP, which is probably where the UI design choices from AIMP came from. It also had the iconic Milkdrop visualizer and whatever else was popular with people, something I enjoyed heavily. However when looking between AIMP and WinAmp, they were almost the same thing to me. On top of that, Spotify looked a little nicer, and WinAmp, it felt off. Spotify was a different beast, which we'll have to get to in a minute.<br><br>Then it kind of crashed down. Apparently WinAmp had not been the same since it's glory days, the last widely favored release being 5.666. But I was using a version later than that. So the real question was, what now?<br><br>I tried more players, tried returning to childhood favorites. Tried SoundCloud and found it's selection kind of mediocre, only good for a few songs at best. I became briefly obsessed with obscure players, sometimes going to bizzare lengths to try new setups. But nothing was entirely satisfying. So instead, I just stuck with what I knew and waited for life to throw a bone. I transitioned from YouTube downloading my music to using ThePirateBay torrents and took my loss.<br><br>We are going to briefly skip ahead, to 2023. That was the day I learnt about WinAmp's downfall, and their transition to v6, which was distasteful and very boring to me. Plus they had briefly tried to go into NFTs apparently, trying to sell of the OG WinAmp UI as an NFT. That was dumb and I didn't get any of it.<br>But looming over it was like a hand from the heavens, coming to bring me a refresher, something new. Sure, it was pretty much WinAmp, but it was something better. Something that was separated from the original company.<br>WACUP.<br><br>So then I tried WACUP. I recognized all the same things, but at the time, I was so distant from WinAmp, that everything was new enough to enjoy. It added more things to WinAmp, it had more things to enjoy, more optimizations and the like. And being run by who I think was one of the original WinAmp developers, it was a win. But once again, comparing to AIMP, they felt very similar in many aspects, and once again, I felt myself wanting more.<br><br>And now we have to talk about big brother. Spotify. Let's go back to 2018.<br><br>I turned to Spotify during the summer of that year, somewhere around 2 years after first being obsessed with WMP12. The convenience appealed to me, and while I wouldn't get to enjoy some of the exclusives I loved when I was in the AIMP/WMP12 era, but at the time it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. I skipped out on my favorites that were limited to the Japan editions and whatnot, but it was a sacrifice I wanted to make for convenience.<br><br>And so I did. For about 2 more years, I stuck with Spotify, only occasionally switching away from Spotify when I started to grow a hate for it's Local Files feature just to use a music player. And I was happy for the most part, kind of just taking hit after hit from Spotify over the years. I put up with the video ads, I put up with the audio ads, I gave in to the ads just to have convenience in my life, in a time where I didn't know that there was better options. I only briefly knew the history of platforms like Limewire then, I didn't know what I was doing. So I turned to the popular option. Hoping for some kind of help.<br><br>And over the years, it was finally unlocked in me. For two years, I took hit after hit, continuing to stick with Spotify. When using Discord, I kept using Spotify for rich presence, not knowing about the other options once again. My option was set in stone, cold as ice. I never turned back permanently, Spotify has locked me in.<br><br>That's what it had looked like. Slowly, the plugs would be pulled. I would finally turn to a music player and start to enjoy that more than Spotify. And coincidentally, all the right plugs would also be pulled on many features. The support for the original December 2013-2014 clients that Spotify used to have would break, it's functionality would eventually die out. Many songs would be taken down over the years, including various songs that I listened to often, and when those were out of the picture, the rope was put very thin. Spotify would also kill some of it's API which would also break functionalities in some players outside of Spotify, preventing them from streaming audio from Spotify even if you had Premium. And now more recently, Lyrics were killed. I had enough. I left Spotify, and while I would return a few more times to give it a second chance, it wouldn't always do the trick. I still wanted more.<br><br>I would try a few more players, and even briefly become attached to the similar player MusicBee. MusicBee would end up also being briefly good, but then I would find I wanted more features, once again. MB was great but it didn't have entirely what I was looking for. So then I set eyes on foobar2000, my next choice. The round killer.<br><br>At first, foobar2000 was kind of just any other player for me. I would use it on and off between ~2020 and 2023, mainly going between foobar2000 and MusicBee. I would miss the features of the player I wasn't using, make the hop, then feel it all again. I missed foobar2000's simplicity. I missed MusicBee's discord plugin. I missed foobar2000's component ecosystem. I missed MusicBee's rating feature. It would go on and on. It would be like a nonstop battle for about three years.<br><br>And that brings me to around September 2023. After some extensive modding of foobar2000, I would eventually get the player in a pretty good state. And by that point, it was too late for me to switch. I was so invested in the things you could do with foobar2000, I was just hooked. You could change anything. You could add new buttons next to the pause and skip and backwards buttons, you could add new functionality. I played around with everything, from adding viewable lyrics to the player, to AIMP bookmarking, A-B loop, Discord Rich Presence, waveform minibar, YouTube playback... The list goes on.<br><br>The idea of components would come and go, I would grow very satisfied. I would change my layout often, trying to get new ideas, and I would expand my taste by researching and adding features from other players I liked. I eventually also added artwork to the playlist view, a change I stuck with since. Overall, my listening experience was just better.<br><br>I would also learn about ReplayGain this way, as well as the various formats outside of MP3. FLAC was finally known to me. I got to experiment with OGG and learn about the OPUS format. I also finally got a very basic idea about how music rips were made, even learning to make my own, learning to keep a local collection of music that would never be pulled as long as I kept it untampered as long as possible. It was like a personal haven.<br><br>And that brings us to today.<br><br>For the past year, I have been using the 64-bit version of foobar2000, mainly for the performance benefits. It's new, futureproof, I was sold on the illusion that it would just perform better, and for a while I had no requirements that required me to go back, at least for a while.<br><br>That was until now, obviously. I was growing rather bored of the current hacky, very rough solution for my problem. It was not only very rough and buggy, I had broken folders in folders on my own accord and I just wanted it to be hassle free. So I decided to pick myself up and turned to the 32-bit side again, having become interested in Spider Monkey Panel, which was an updated version of a foobar2000 component that allowed adding JS to the player. Without a second thought, I kicked the door down and walked right into the land this morning, to play around and find new adventures.<br><br>I had originally planned to return to my original solution, however after hearing the great things about SMPanel, I gave it a try. And I was pleasantly amazed, after some setup and some hammering of my own. It had in fact worked how I hoped it would, and more! It was not perfect obviously, but it was less fragile than my original implementation. Bit by bit, I got it configured to my needs and I had finally made it home to the player that I wanted so much.<br><br>The only thing that made me downgrade from x64 to x32 is the current state of foobar2000 components. Currently, the world has been split into two. There are the legacy 32-bit components that everybody else is desperately clinged onto, and the 64-bit lands, that is future-proof in case the technology industry pulls the plug. Somehow we are still alive, but the thing is, many legacy components won't update to also support x64. Some components go back to the early 2010s and even the late 2000s! Sure, that makes a good history lesson, and that admittedly turns us into a history channel, but the thing is not everybody wants history. Some people just want to update to x64 thinking they need it, or thinking x32 doesn't work. So then what do we do?<br><br>We just have to wait. SMP won't update to x64 for a while, that would require SMP v2 to be finished, and we got at least a few more years. So I guess I'm going to be stuck here, on x32. Where everybody's happy and nostalgic.<br><br>At least it's better than not having it at all, right?</p><p>Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.</p><p>You are excused.<br></p>]]>

    <title>The Games: A Bloody Downgrade</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>backported from spacehey blogs</small></p>
<h1>An Unexpected Collab</h1><p>Before I get into the main blog, I just want to clear this up.</p><p>For this blog, I have collaborated with fellow SpaceHey user&nbsp;<a href="https://spacehey.com/hkrk40k" target="_self">Nova</a> on this blog, as we worked together to investigate a good handful of games on this event. I wouldn't be able to cover as many bases as I did without their help, and it took a good few days to work with them on a project this large. We worked collaboratively across about 4 days, and we're glad to be able to show this to you today.l</p><p>Many thanks to them for a lot of the information here, I couldn't do any of this without your help!</p><h1>Sources</h1><p>* - one person provided surface level information on the game and the other dived right in to confirm it</p><p><br>A majority of my sources come from actually diving in blind in the Hub and finding games by random.&nbsp;<br>Though I still have some people that I used to source information and all that. First of all, I'd like to thank&nbsp;<a href="https://spacehey.com/lazt_ee" target="_self">Nova</a> for diving in blind with me, as well as providing some info on some games I ended up having no time to play.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/18320910606/The-Games" target="_self">It is highly recommended you dive in the game blind yourself to confirm a lot of what I said.</a> This is the only way you can reliably back up my sources, because let's be real, it's better to fact check yourself.</p><p>As Nova and I have both provided different information of the games on this event, and since we have chosen different games, I have labeled in the games part of the blog who played what game, so you know who provided the information.</p><p><br></p><p>That being said, let's start, at last.</p><h1>A Rocky Start (Intro)</h1><p>To say that ROBLOX's new events have been on a very unstable start is, in my personal opinion, an understatement. And is this event able to carry what the last event failed to do?&nbsp;</p><p>Not really.</p><h1>A Surprise Drop?</h1><p>On the afternoon of August 1st, I discovered that The Games dropped. I had no hype for this event, as by this point, it was all drained from me. As I waited for The Hunt, I was interested in it's sudden return, but by the end, I had no interest in the event at all.</p><p>It had already stung people a lot that The Hunt ended up not focusing on Easter, a holiday that was basically recent news when The Hunt dropped. It was really devastating to see this new corporate taste on the old "Egg Hunt" format we all knew. The "developer hunt" style of the previous Egg Hunts from as far back as 2019 already dissapointed players, and even viewed the developers as lazy, rather than make their own unique game special made for the egg hunt.</p><p>That was a completely different ladder step. Now there was a completely new low for egg hunts, and it was coming to town: A soulless mess devoid of any easter mention.</p><p>When The Classic came around, I hoped it would be better than the last. I had low hope, knowing how ROBLOX operates and it's long list of controversies the site has gathered, but I did end up trying to hold on. When The Classic came around, I played it, and posted a full blog about it. The short part of the story is that it just wasn't any better to me. It was too short, wasn't worth it, a myriad of other issues.</p><p>This time around? I expected it to be dogwater. I had no hope for this event, and rightfully so. The Hunt was a shit event. The Classic was an upgrade to nothing short of horrendous. And right on queue, The Games followed right behind, it's stench following. Where The Hunt overdid itself and bloated itself up MASSIVELY, and The Classic cut users off with a short event during the busiest time for students around, The Games was different in one regard.</p><p>This event did have one thing going for it, and that was diverting my expectations. I don't remember if the release date was announced, so maybe I was just tuned out. But basically, I was actually not counting down for it, it came to me out of nowhere. I was checking out a Michael's Zombies update, and then it kicked in:<br>Oh my god, the new event is out.<br><br>But the excitement quickly died down after one game. Well given, there was little excitement at all, but whatever of it had spawned had basically immediately died down by game two. And that's saying something as I tried to be optimistic for The Hunt and appreciative for The Classic. However, it has now occurred to me what kind of future we're having with events. And as I see it, it's unoriginal, copy pasted, and just underwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>You wanna know what else is copy pasted? "The games" doing their part. It's always the three quest format, nobody tries anything ambitious, nobody tries the gladiator theme, nobody tries anything that stands out. It's just a bunch of people sporatically making something that grinds out Premium Payouts and that is it. Copy pasted, tedious events, that make you milk money to the highest bidder.</p><p>Or even better, the copy pasted names used to name these past three events!&nbsp;I mean come on, fucking "The Games"?! How do you design something so utterly, fucking, sh-</p><p><small>sorry to cut you off, past kam, but we have to move on now!</small></p><h1>Yet No Different</h1><p>And this event still manages to be like the other two events we've seen. If anything, it seemed to be worse. They clearly didn't write down how we enjoyed the little selection from The Classic, and went back to the million game selection they did in The Hunt. It's already pissing me off how only the FIRST prize from the event was non-Layered Clothing (excluding the wings, and maybe one other prize, most of it is layered clothing), a ROBLOX feature I have no use for. But the massive spike in game presence in this event came back to spite me, I guess. Long live being able to choose what you want to play when you can just overwhelm the user, right?</p><p>At least they provide more time than The Classic. More time as in like... I don't know, 3-5 more days. That's still like what, 10 days? It's a little better than the classic, but when you account for the game selection increase, they don't really do you much justice. Sure, it's better, and during the most free time of year, but keep in mind that there's about maybe 50 games, and only ~10 days to do it, give or take. But before we go on another ramble about time crunch, let's move on. The game selection.</p><p>The game selection is still shit. They tried to make up for it by adding actually good games like Michael's Zombies, RoBeats and Arsenal, but they still flopped by adding Adopt Me, more shovelware garbage, Survive the Killer and Tongue Battles of all games. I genuinely had to wipe my eyes for a moment, because I felt like I was seeing double considering the weird shit they pulled this event. Process this, they added stuff from the past two events, again. On top of that, they added a game about fighting with your TONGUE of all things, and on top of that, they added a bunch of games that do nothing but milk the money out of you. Was the goal to make money or to enlighten people?</p><p>Actually, let's talk MORE about the game selection while we're here, because it's just as nonsensical as The Classic. Dress to Impress and Fashion Famous at once? RoBeats and Funky Friday, two rhythm games based on completely different franchises? Better yet, how did Adopt Me make it to all three of these events? Let alone Michael's Zombies, which appears to be the only 13+ game on this list, which they sure weren't open to last time. Speaking of, how the fuck is Bad Business all ages? Somebody forgot about the gun UGC wipe. Fucking fantastic.</p><p>Oh don't even worry about games, we're not even DONE talking about them! Let's talk more about the fact the games still don't fucking try! There is still a huge issue in many games where the objective is not clearly labeled, many games still do not follow the theme, and better yet, most of the games are STILL pay to win grinding.</p><p>ROBLOX game events have been garbage this year. It's amazing this was approved at all. The gladiator esque theme is cool, but we all know no game is going to follow it. I mean, go talk to Guts and Gunpowder and see if they give a fuck. Go ask if Michael's Zombies will make a roman themed event. Nobody cares about the theme, they just want you to stay around them. It just adds onto the disappointment for this event that the theme was again ignored, let alone what kind of shit they were on when they made the teams. How the fuck were they named and made, again? Why is there a team named "Giant Feet"? Who are the kinds of people making these fucking teams? Why does Kreek have a dynamic head on, doesn't he NOT use one?</p><p>No, you can't make this shit up. This event takes the cake. I genuinely had to limit my range of games to make this review digestible. Both for your sanity and for mine. This shit is worthless. It is already hard to take seriously an event that announces in chat when you join "the built different team Giant Feet team". There is some serious problems with ROBLOX's moderation team. This have to be a nightmare for some kind of Internal team.</p><p>"This is where Legends are made" my ass. The only legend being made is the legend of the awful event series. Wait until somebody drops one all over this event and spray paints over it.</p><h1>Game Specific Stuff</h1><p>Okay, meta time for a second, I fucked this up on the last blog. I threw things at you at once, that wasn't fair. So let's do it right.</p><p>Every game will have it's own category to not bloat the other sections, as it should have been. We'll talk about each game one by one and split them up so they can have space. Now the review should be more digestible and can be enjoyed a little easier.</p><p>Since this is also a collaboration blog, I have included who played what games. Just so you know which one of us this is coming from.</p><p>Now let's go.</p><h2>Funky Friday (oh boy)</h2><p>[Information from kam106, played by Nova &amp; kam106]</p><p>Funky Friday was so interesting, because it was the second game I played. We'll get to the first game in a minute, but first I need to absolutely RANT about this game for a moment.<br></p><p>The first quest is, for a rhythm game... An obby! Ah yes, a musical genre known for just jumping across burgers, donuts and pool floaties for ten minutes. This is definitely what I expect for this game, where the protagonist Blue Hair has to jump across floating objects to get to his girlfriend!&nbsp;</p><p>...That's probably a real thing in an alternative universe of our own, but maybe let's not think about that right now.</p><p>About the last two quests now. I'm not going to hide it, I am dogshit at Friday Night Funkin'. I was never active when the game gained popularity, and therefore, my skills for the game basically don't exist. Not only that, but I generally never cared for it, being more occupied with other projects of mine, such as my side music project. So, I never really played. I'd listen to a soundtrack or two, that was it. So when I found out this game was in the event, I generally hoped it would at least be easy. The first quest was simple enough, completing an obby in 10 minutes. All was left was to beat three levels and beat somebody's ass in 3 of 6 songs. After all, who would gatekeep event items based on skill, right?</p><p>...Right?</p><p>Oh boy, that was a fun thing to say to myself. Especially after finding out there was a score cap you had to reach before you could earn anything. I scored under that in two of three of the levels at once. But not only do they add this to the second quest, they added it to the third one! So you can forget about cheesing the fight. If you go one under the bar, that's no reward for you, bucko!</p><p>I don't know what it is, if I'm just severely under the skill cap, or my eyes need an adjustment, or if I genuinely need some kind of practice, because I was having a pretty bad time on this game. It was so bad in fact, this is the one game that made me account swap. Through this entire event. And it gave me so bad of a headache, I had to actually clear my mind WHILE I did this. So having that on my mind paired with this game? Yeah, that was not fun. At all.</p><p>Nova and I tackled it anyway and we just decided to be ourselves for the event. And after all, that was just one game. Surely the others won't be as terrible?</p><h2>Michael's Zombies</h2><p>[Information from kam106, played by Nova &amp; kam106]</p><p>Okay, now THIS was the first game in the event I played. This game is both better and worse than Funky Friday in it's unique ways, but for the most part, it's an improvement!</p><p>First off, it involves a hub! Not a small thing to note, but a nice, welcome addition. It's well made and has some features that seamlessly integrate with gameplay, such as using it's tropical theming to make the biggest mechanic fit in with the theme. If you didn't understand what I just said: You can buy drinks from coolers. Review over.<br>Just kidding, let's talk more.</p><p>I wasn't a fan of the minigames present during this little event hub, but they were nice touches. There's a baseball field minigame, a minigame where you can grab your grandfather's Garand to go skeet shooting, and even a reskin of the map Lighthouse. I generally liked the Lighthouse bit of the map the most, running in with water guns you can buy at the Mystery Box, and going in with the perks you buy at the coolers to get a bunch of points. Maybe I just really like killing zombies.</p><p>Extending on the Lighthouse challenge, you can't go down and die immediately. So they definitely had a casual idea in mind, as going down just forces you back up with most of your perks removed. So at least you can't die and take forever to return to where you were. That's really nice, and better than the normal stressful modes where at a moment's notice you could lose it all.</p><p>The minigames are alright. I really liked the creative theming Michael's Zombies showed through this event, as well as using sport rackets for melee weapons as well as a baseball bat as a free melee. Another fresh addition is the themeing of perk colas as cooler sodas, as well as it's use of minigames and the overall theme of a tropical resort. Great refreshment from the stressful loop of shoot zombie, spend money.&nbsp;</p><p>Better than many games on this list, despite myself not favoring it.</p><h2>Arsenal</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova &amp; kam106]</p><p>I never liked Arsenal's The Classic event. In fact, I hated it. The Hunt had a better event, one I enjoyed way more. So going into Arsenal, I expected myself to absolutely hate this game's event. So, I went in for shits and giggles.</p><p>But I am short of impressed. Maybe it's the fact I hated The Classic's version of the event to my bone. It was so unclear. So I went in, giving the game another try. And you know what? That was a good choice.</p><p>I attempted my first try completely solo, which ended up being nothing short of a nightmare, as expected with running in blind. With the lack of backup on my side and having nobody to back me up when I make careless mistakes? It was obviously a terrible shot. I was tired as well, so I ended up giving it a second thought with Nova and we went in together for our second try (their first was with one of my friends, where both of them won it first try, I ended up quitting before finishing). And it was this run where we finally finished the questline. But I will say, just like The Hunt, this is one of the highlights of the event.</p><p>Arsenal takes a very interesting turn on the event, converting the game into a rogue kind of game (i don't know the term, please excuse my wording) with cards offering advantages, and your classic arsenal of weaponry being able to be bought at checkpoint shops, known as "The Blank Check". The environment feels like a casino, while not gladiator themed, it does feel like an arena at times, which does give it points for at least somewhat trying to add to the theme. Somehow.</p><p>I tried not to spoil much, but the game is a nice addition to this event and is a nice minigame I'd return to if I was really bored.</p><p>The quests, to give it credit, are actually fucking digestible. Kill 20 enemies in one go, beat the first floor without buying items, beat all 3 floors in one go. It's nice, to the point, and not a grind fest. Unlike some games on this list...</p><p>Generally, better than everything else featured here.</p><h2>Horrific Housing</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by kam106]</p><p>I'm sorry for the lack of words for this section of the review, as I genuinely had to stop playing within the first slideshow. I didn't even bother to complete the event on this game.</p><p>I already wish I could have enough attention span to finish this game, I really hoped it would motivate me to return to the game. No, they turn around and force you first thing to survive a flood, a RANDOMLY CHOSEN EVENT. WHO CHECKS THIS SHIT?! This event continues to find ways to amaze me and this is the biggest part of it so far. How the fuck do you do that? Locking event completion behind a random number generator event, let alone behind an event that possibly has it's odds rigged? It's a tasteless move.</p><p>Let alone from a game that last had it's prime in what, 2018? The nostalgia factor ended around 2020 in my case, and after 2020 there was literally no reason to return to this game. Watching the potential be thrown away for this game is just...</p><p>Fuck this, next game.</p><h2>Shrek Swamp Tycoon</h2><p>This game is just boring. For a game that piggybacks off of a popular franchise like Shrek, I refuse to believe somebody on the development forgot to add indication on your-</p><p>Wait sorry, wrong blog post.</p><h2>Sonic Speed Simulator</h2><p>[Information provided by Nova &amp; kam106, played by Nova]</p><p>Holy shit, this event finds new ways to disappoint. I knew this game would have completely flopped one way or another after seeing The Hunt force you to collect a hundred random collectibles with no real purpose or end goal, at least not clearly described. I found this part of The Hunt agonizing and forgettable. Waste of potential.</p><p>I guess this time they looked back on their past actions and thought, "Add over ten times as much for The Games". I already have a distaste for Gamefam's mistreatment of employees and their poor response to said allegations, seeing Sonic Speed Simulator proceed to make their questline as boring and stressful as possible. I'm seriously convinced their goal was not to make a fun event, but to maximize what they can get from the Premium Payouts. Fuck Gamefam.</p><p>The only benefit is that you can collect all of these things that look like Chaos Emeralds (nicknamed McGuffins, as seen on the last blog about The Hunt) on the first stage, Green Hill Zone. Other than that, this game is awfully executed with an average time of 15 minutes, possibly up to an hour to complete for those that are slower. On top of that, Gamefam's controversial history, bad treatment of employees and it's controversial history is not only a huge fuckup on ROBLOX's part, but also a horrible taste on this event.</p><p>...Hey wait a minute. What's that, you collected all thousand of your little McGuffins? BAM, two more right over your head! Get a perfect .1 frame time in one of our time trials and beat a metal sonic in a race! Yeah, thanks a lot for the jumpscare when I read TMNT, asshole. I thought you would have made me grinded like the other games.</p><p>Speaking of, how does the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fit into all of this? They're busy eating pizza and slowly morphing from sewer radiation, not joining Sonic in a friendly race. Or maybe I'm just missing the point, I don't know.</p><p>The name of the quests too... "Cowabunga" further playing on the TMNT collab. This is so fucking random. At least "Give It Your Best" kind of fits with the time trial quest. "Wanna Go Fast" is an unrelated name for the Thousand McGuffin Grind (trademark).<br></p><p>Moving on before I just get more frustrated.</p><h2>Epic Minigames</h2><p>[Information provided by Nova, played by kam106]*</p><p>Just like a line of games mass produced in a factory, Epic Minigames blends in the bland and low effort quests as seen in many other games in this event. Going from a Smurfs event in 2016 where they have a completely original minigame to complete for a prize, this game has lost all of it's originality and charm for a simple three mission questline that has NOTHING to do with the game's theme. While we're at it, let's just say the Gladiator theming is off the charts and the whole thing is freestyle. Yes, that will explain the dogshit decisions made throughout this entire event!</p><p>This is even more fun because Epic Minigames doesn't make it immediately clear that this is what you're supposed to do. All you know is that there's a bunch of shit on your screen and that this game is in the event. I had to deliberately search the menus to find out, oh shit, there's 3 missions on your screen in the bottom right, and THAT is what you have to do for the event! And there's an optional fourth if, surprise, you buy VIP! Gotta love gatekeeping and paying to win, right?</p><p>This isn't even all of it, because they also refresh the missions daily, making the whole thing an unnecessary power push. So, you have to dedicated a whole DAY to completing randomized tasks, in hopes that you get a three that you can do without buying their stupid subscription or something.</p><p>Again, this is putting your fate in the hands of a random number generator. This is borderline gatekeeping by skill if you look at it at the right angle. What kind of shit are people smoking when they make these events, when in the end, it's worse than the events that preceeded them?</p><p>And the whole big thing is you don't even know if ROBLOX enforced a bland event or if the developers just didn't try. It's left ENTIRELY up to interpretation. What a load of shit.</p><h2>RoBeats</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova]</p><p>Let's tackle the elephant in the room first with a nice, iron polished dagger:<br>Why is there two rhythm games in this event?</p><p>We already have Funky Friday, which was allegedly bought by Gamefam (flashback to the Sonic Speed Simulator part of the blog), and had several people through it's lifetime object to it's existance and additions, INCLUDING tweets made by Ninja Muffin. Oh, that's not enough? Throw in a guitar hero clone, that'll get them excited and fighting over their fangames.</p><p>Do you want to have more fun? Find three friends who will play three rounds of this game. And as far as I can guess, any three songs. Well, that will be hard, finding two other friends available to join you, you need a three person lobby. You could always play with strangers, but who knows if they have a score cap like Funky Friday did. You might have to beat everybody there for all anybody knows.</p><p>Okay, cool. We did that. What's next on the questline? Surprise, a three page list of tasks to complete for points! Get to 1k points total worth of tasks to get your damn reward.&nbsp;</p><p>It's math time, put on your nerd glasses. The only 500 point task requires you to do another 7 more songs (possibly another 10!) with those said 3 friends, from there you can complete 250 x 2. Your only other hope is to get 250 x 3 (3 max 250 point tasks) that requires the foremented 3 song thing to be done possibly another 3 times over, as well as winning a single match with 3+ people, and completing 10 songs of any difficulty, this time the player count not accounted for. It could be solo, or only with 10 people at once.</p><p>Okay, let's say we did the 250 x 3 route. That's 750 points, you did one half of the remaining two tasks. To do the other, you'll have to do the 200 quest which is getting a B rank on an "extended cut" song, whatever that is, that's 950. Now you can do any other task, like queueing a song on Robeat's radio for 50 points. There you go, 1k reached, you can finally leave this math mess. Take the nerd glasses off.</p><p>That was a lot of math for a game about rhythm. Thanks for the micro math lesson, let's not do it again. We're moving on before somebody starts complaining about the math.</p><h2>Pull a Sword</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova]</p><p>Pull a Sword... Oh, the distasteful adventures we had on The Hunt. I see you have come back with a harder hitting grind. One worse than the Pet Sim 99 grind. You're not special for that.</p><p>This game does a very funny. Funny, as in completely realistic depiction of David Bazooka being powerful and daunting, boasting what seems to be 100 billion strength. What a simulator type scenario for a simulator type shovelware game.</p><p>And holy shit, it should not take over fourty minutes to grind for this event, let alone 15 minutes of that being back to back. Why 40 minutes, you ask? Well, for 100 billion strength. It took almost 50 minutes to reach 200 billion to cheese the bossfight. Guess what was earned in the first 40. A measely 23 billion strength. Do the math, that's about two tenths of what you need, 2/10 for those who need it visualized. 2/10 of 100B, in 40 minutes.</p><p>I just can't put it any other way. It's actually mindblowing how this shit is laid out. And you have to earn about 200 billion strength to completely cheese the fight. Well shit, I didn't know I was getting screwed over that way too! We're just inventing new ways to inflict mental pain on the end user, are we? How about you do that by making a game addicting enough that it makes sense and DRAWS people to it's fairness, not so painful that you wish you blew your brains out in five minutes.</p><p>Oh but that's just the FINAL quest. First, they make you do an obby, basically ripping Funky Friday's concept right out of their hands and slamming it onto their questline. Gee, is everybody obsessed with jumping over burgers, donuts and long stone platforms that mimic the platforms seen on Speed Run 4 all of a sudden, what's next, jumping over-</p><p>Oh yeah, forgetful Kam! Who doesn't like ripping off their childhood games in their commercial masterpiece? Yeah, this game rips off Speed Run 4 during it's obby section, straight down to the yellow brick that gives you your superhuman speed. This is like what, 10 minutes in no less? I didn't know we were against the idea of adding Speed Run 4 when a miniscule ripoff of it already exists in my simulator type beat... God, fuck this game.</p><p>Plus the second quest is already a grind in itself. Pulling ten swords? Yeah, thanks for making the most insignificant part of the questline being the game title. God, fuck this game. And that's sure a lot coming from a group that calls themself xFrozen Obbies. Just go back to making shovelware obbies, simulator games do not fit your style.</p><h2>Pet Catchers (honorable mention)</h2><p>[Information provided by Nova]</p><p>This one will be short since we're almost done. There is this game, Pet Catchers. We didn't bother to play it properly because this was near the end of the The Games grind session. Plus, we got some flashbacks from The Hunt on my end, since I was reminded of Pet Sim 99 and another game that was pretty forgettable. I still forgot the name to that one.</p><p>We looked at this game last and went "yeah, that's enough of this for the day". It had three tasks (as expected of most of the copy paste garbage on this event), the top one? "Complete 3 soccer quests". I didn't know we were moving to a game of soccer, mother. There's also a quest for pet racing, one that says you just need to complete for. But complete can mean anything from playing a match to winning one. So do I win 3 matches or just play 3 matches? And another generic NPC quest on top of it.</p><p>There are worse games when it comes to this kind of thing, but we were so exhausted, we just gave up. It wasn't worth the effort. That was it.</p><p>Let's get to the meat.</p><h2>Super Golf</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova]</p><p>This is one of those games where I had to get details through somebody else, so excuse exaggerations.</p><p>Holy shit, this game manages like a mess. The first quest of the entire GAME requires you to go to HOCKEY MODE to score 10 goals. HOCKEY MODE. IN A GAME ABOUT GOLF. Let your mind process that for just one minute. There is a supposed hockey mode in a game called "Super Golf". If that does not register as "what the fuck" in your brain, I don't know what you were thinking.<br></p><p>Not only that, but the game gives no clear indication of where this supposedly Hockey Mode exists, leaving the end user to just go looking for it on their own accord. Hello? The fuck? If you're going to introduce a user to a nonsensical part of the game, and force them to grind for a part of your game for a questline that does not revolve around you, at the very LEAST show the path. Various games already do this, and even sometimes auto-open the quest menu for you. There should be no reason why this game cannot do the same, holy shit.</p><p>On top of this, the first gamemode that was presented upon joining, is guess what: Basketball. That is now a count of TWO unrelated sports in a golf game, those being Hockey and Basketball. Now there is a server browser that lets you find servers currently hosting "hockey", which ends up just being golf with a hockey goal, but again, the game doesn't properly show you where this is.</p><p>And on top of that, not only does the game poorly guide the player and force them to grind a game, basically milking Premium Payouts, but the game also hides all three objectives until you finish them as you go. Meaning, if you're on the first objective, everything else is completely hidden. You have to work your way to the light overtime, possibly having the objectives ALSO change per player (not confirmed, so don't bank on it) and whatever other torture the developers can add on top of it as they wish.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially when you remember this is the millionth game to do this, this just a slow turbulance into madness. Speaking of madness!</p><h2>Obby But You're On A Bike / Bike Obby</h2><p>Just like the last time this game was featured in an event, this game is the worst part of the event, not by a lot, but it's up there in the top 5 of issues in my book.</p><p>Seriously, who the fuck let this game in twice? You're locked into doing "races" with people, being forced to complete stages that are FAR ahead what the average beginner will be at for any given game. Nobody wants to skip ahead to fucking, World 2 just to complete an event. Or race a bunch of assholes three times over. LET ALONE TOP 3. NO. FUCK NO.</p><p>Let alone trying to do Time Trials on this garbage. Who would want to stomach a full event world if you're left tasteless by the first five minutes? Do I look like I'm accepting this game to you? It still doesn't end there because they throw a bunch of fucking popups at you. "Your friend is online, invite them for a free bike!", fucking "Spin our wheel that's rigged and pre-determined so you can smash a table when you don't get it", hello??? Who approved this??</p><p>They get to count cash, you arrive on their doorstep and they do this to you for...</p><p>Completely free! They fuck you for completely free! For completely free, you can let the developers of this game fuck you over, no extra cost! It's mind boggling what kind of shit they put you through. It's a load of nothing but shi-</p><p><font size="1">For all viewer's security, Kam has been removed from the stage. Please accept their clone, Cameron instead, while the blog post concludes.</font></p><h1>More to the Fire</h1><p>If you're looking for more to throw to the fire, then there is not much farther to look, with such an event like this. In a bittersweet, almost void-of-ideas move on the behalf of the corporation, they have rehashed the 1x1x1x1 bossfight from The Classic. If you ever felt this project from ROBLOX doesn't do enough to rehash ideas that nobody really asked for, or for disappointments to remind themselves of, ROBLOX has gladly given you the luxury to be disappointed by the lack of rewards once again.</p><p>Holy shit, this event is actually amazing. It keeps innovating in ways to upset the player and does nothing to show off the legacy of the platform, as it had the last event. On top of the bad selection, the lack of classic representation and the moderation team missing "Giant Feet" with a literal feet graphic for a team, they throw rehashed ideas and cashgrab titles your way.<br><br></p><p>What a horrible way to conclude this kind of event. Well, that was a fun grind, right? We fought through the gallows, pushed our way to the top, and we finally did the bare minimum. There is just one item left.</p><p>Or is there more to this?</p><p>A hidden part of this event is hidden in plain sight, but placed right on the table for the unlucky bastards that get to the top of the ranks. You'll very quickly find out that the last item is locked behind... Most Valuable Player status.</p><p>And the way to score this seems to be completely random. Maybe you need to complete more games than the rest of your team to get it, I don't know. It's massively unclear. So basically, if you join a massive team like Crimson Cats, the item is paywalled. "Yeah, have fun with your MVP status if you even get it at all, buddy. We don't want you around here."</p><p>Plus, who knows if these items will be taken from you at any time? They could take the wings from you if another player got above your status. What if that happens, what can you do except go on the grind again and defend your winged reward until another cuts your flying ability off from the stem?</p><p>After all, what's left for us at all?</p><h1>A Sour End</h1><p>Okay, I think I lost some brain cells writing this really passive aggressive blog. But at the least, we made it to the end as a team. Nova and I are exhausted. And personally?</p><p>Fuck this event with fingers up high.<br>The real warriors are the fighters are the bottom.</p>]]>

    <title>The Classic: A Repeat of the Past</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>backported from spacehey blogs</small></p>
<p>First post here, it's a sequel to a rant to another ROBLOX event I've talked about before with my heart.<br></p><p>Update: Added a tiny bit more information following The Games, as I felt I didn't add enough when writing.</p><h1>Sources<br></h1><p>Just want to clear up where my research is from first, because it's best if you look into this yourself before reading my yap and coming to your own conclusions.<br><br></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfa0w33_T14" target="_self">Chizeled's video is a good place to start.</a>&nbsp;As I'm writing this, it only came out like an hour ago! I used it to double check some research such as with the "pay to win" items, some points, etc. Watch it if you wanna learn more!<br></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77EdrxzLb2M" target="_self">This greenlegocats video will explain the Live Ops and Boys and Girls Dance Club thing a little better.</a>&nbsp;Yes, it actually happened. Start watching at 10:45 and see for yourself.<br></li><li><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/17427651911/" target="_self">Play the event yourself too!!!</a>&nbsp;I got most of my game claims from the games themselves, and tried to include screenshots if I remembered.</li></ul><h1>History's Introduction</h1>Okay, so what makes a normal ROBLOX event fun? Well, they should last maybe a month, they should have a good selection of games, and you shouldn't be left confused and lost. The more memorable the event the better, but normally that doesn't make a difference.<br><br>Now, The Hunt: First Edition? It at least made an attempt, but it overwhelmed people with it's 100 games, did easter events in a style people found lazy ("dev hunts"), most of the items ended up being really expensive and event exclusive, and there was very little free prizes among other things. Despite those issues, The Hunt was a return to ROBLOX events and while it had many flaws, some that completely ruined the event, it still had potential and needed some serious feedback to be improved.<br><br>And The Classic?<br>Worse than the last event (subjectively). Hear me out.<br><br><h1>Crunched for Time</h1><br>Let's address the elephant in the room: The Classic just doesn't give you enough time to really grind at your own comfortable pace. It has better compacting sure, and has less games, but the amount of items is still the same! And you'll have to play the same game several times! Not only in a way that's possibly unfair (i.e: completing a whole minigame with crap teammates, super high difficulty etc), but also you only get a week to do it! Why put in effort when there is no effort? That's why I tried it for a few hours, then didn't bother. The grind wasn't even worth it. Lazy of me, sure, but wouldn't that make ROBLOX just as lazy of a company for making this garbage? We gave lots of feedback, did they not listen to all of it?<br><br>I get that the timeframe celebrates history and it's the time between the site's reaction and trademarks being made, but that's only 5 days. Nobody's going to stomach this entire event in five days! At least, I'm not...<p>Let's also add on the fact most people will be busy with school and work and whatnot. So not only is it too short by regular standards, you leave basically no time for anybody who's actually studying right now! If this isn't the shortsighted part of the event...<br>ROBLOX. You are a KIDS game. If the KIDS are busy studying, why would you engineer this event during this time? THINK.<br><br>Not only that, but it also has the same issues as the last event. Most of the good items that were showcased were either pay high amounts to get, or they ended up being extremely tedious to get. Not only that, but there's the same amount of items spread across each game: You can still only get one measly item every few days, and there's still only 5 total. So there's very little to earn without paying, too much to earn by paying. The only real improvement in that area is that they removed the Robux tiers. Even then, they did Tix VERY dirty by making it buy items you can only use in the lobby. The fuck? I don't wanna use a rocket launcher in just one single game, what is this?<br><br>The main prizes aren't even that good. The first item makes no fucking sense to me, the fuck is this? A wrap for my arms? It surely doesn't look like a Tixsplosion reskin. Other than that, I will say that there's accuracy in some of the items, to some degree. There's a buckethead, a helm, and that one hat that gives you wings and a halo. Personally a step up from the ugly and hardly fitting items from last time. Now, that's a huge improvement, but unfortunately still-<br>What? They're making avatar items more expensive AGAIN? Nope, that sounds like modern ROBLOX.<br>Oh, even better, you added back the items you have to pay robux for? And they're still identical to the main items except in gold? Great, what a wonderful event!<br><br>Let's continue to the event itself now.<br><br></p><h1>Inconsistencies, Ahoy!</h1><br>Now, I am not by any means an older player. Depending on who you ask, either I'm older than most of ROBLOX's active playerbase, or I'm not even close to being an 'older' player. But just hear me out.<br>I think ROBLOX is <b>not </b>properly doing the classic theme. Let me explain.<br><br>Since many active people played past 2016, let's start with the things you're more likely to notice:<br>First off, the UI takes modern design hints. The mute music button uses an emoji, and is placed by the modern icons. Now that would be cool in any other game, but this is a classic themed event. You couldn't have hand drawn an icon? What about doing it how old games did and using the text "Mute Music"? At the least, using old color schemes, like 2013+'s blue and grey, or even 2012's red and black?<br>Less noticably, dialogs and chat. While dialog textures the same as they were in 2015 and later on, they still use 2022+ chat bubbles. The opposite also applies to chat, how the chat box is the modern chat box, but they could of used the old chat box, WHICH BY THE WAY, IS STILL SUPPORTED.<br>I can only assume this was likely a corporate decision. I could say a bunch of reasons why this happened, such as corporate greed, or just a dev team who had no idea about ROBLOX's 18 year history... Holy shit, it's going to have been 18 years in September.<br><br>Anyway, there's also safe chat. Of course, they didn't remove chat for people younger than 13... That would be dumb. But they added that little chat bubble from 2008 where you click options and there's buttons... That thing. But they don't have most of the old dialogs, so it feels more like it's there for novelty rather than accuracy. But at least we have old games featured...<br><br><h1>Not Even Classic!</h1><br>Oh sorry, is this event called The Classic? Are we meant to have some old selection, and are we gonna get an event related to oldschool games? Nope, you DON'T. They hyped the event up by listing actually old games like Crossroads and Natural Disaster Survival, but then jinxed it by making nearly none of the games classic. Not to mention, Toilet Tower Defense of all games being in this list is a good example. It can be argued that Adopt Me and Arsenal earned their slots, sure. But Blade Ball? A last event's game, Driving Empire? Dress to Impress? Fucking a dusty road trip? Hell, there's even games here from First Edition! Was it hard to get new games?<br><br>Speaking of, the version of A Dusty Road Trip featured is supposedly, a ripoff. It's a clone of a similar game, just with a bunch of added gamepasses to make some quick bucks. Basically most modern games on the site nowadays. Hell, what if I told you this wasn't the first time? About 2019, they replaced ROBLOX events with this thing called "Live Ops", which you might recognize instead as "This Week on ROBLOX". Did you know the version of Boys and Girls Dance Club featured was stolen? And it wasn't taken down for a good while too, it got featured for a good few weeks! Great management, ROBLOX.<br><br>It probably also doesn't help that this game is also hell to wrap your head around. Just like the first edition, Adopt Me doesn't seem to have a clear cut button for the event. Arsenal, unlike last event, doesn't have one either. Gunfight Arena has a completely unrelated task you have to do before you can even DO the event stuff that gets you what you want. We're suffering! Is that not enough?<br>It's already a lot that most of these games don't follow the old theming, even for new generation games, although that's to be expected at this point. At least Dress to Impress used squared brick textures and tried to make something! The only real relation Bedwars had to old roblox was the penguins held fucking swords and cokes! Is that the best we get as players? Is there no regulation about using old models and trying to use as little modern models as possible?<br><br><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/0mtv1v.png" alt="Modern model among the old road. Game is A Dusty Road Trip."><br><p><br></p><p>Like what the fuck is this? This looks ugly. You have this modern bag model, and it's on an oldschool road, and all of this oldschool text. It looks so out of place. Arguably our avatars are too, but at least there's a toggle.</p><p>Better yet, even the playerbase has some (cheap, although functional) options to fit in with the classic part of this event. Many choose not to, which only beats the dead horse on this event, but there's at least immersion. The player can CHOOSE to come with a classic avatar to feel more immersed. This game doesn't even bother to immerse you.<br><br></p><h1>Rich people, ahoy!</h1><br>Did you not get enough of this event? You wanna blow your money? You like expensive things? 19k Valkrie bundle, go get it. So great, isn't it? Great to get fucked over like this? There's even one for a fedora, named the "Treasure Hunter"... What am I hunting again? I don't feel like I'm hunting, I feel more like I'm doing chores in the house.<br>Great to spend money to get gold variants of a bunch of shit you won't use in the end? Yeah, me too.<br><br>They did this last event too. Make a bunch of gold variants of the items, make it exclusive to either a 800 Robux gold lineup, a 19k bundle that was limited time, or you can pay it for one item out of pocket. This shit was just one fucked up cash grab, and we all got deep in it. Deep ini the chores list, sure.<br><br>But what's the point in the end? Why are we spending so much? Well, because ROBLOX wants to make MONEY! That's the only way I can assume this event was so bad, that the last event was so rushed, that all of the events before it... Just cheap tricks.<br>Because we aren't getting old events anymore. That's obvious.<br><h1>What Else?</h1><br>Other than that though, that's where it ends. I didn't bother to play much in my, what, 3 hours of playing? In Bedwars I got killed by the void, even though the pixels clearly said I died to a penguin. A dusty trip had a vip room, which apparently has a free tshirt to check what's inside! I didn't look yet, I'm too lazy to continue this dogshit event.<br><br>I got into lobbies with lots of noobs on Bedwars and Bee Swarm Simulator. Livetopia has confusing store layouts, and that task is long and tedious. Feels more like a chore. Arsenal was unclear with how you get the quest done, unlike First Edition. Hell, first edition had a whole singleplayer experience! Why didn't we get something like that again?<br><br>That's a... lot to work with. Wow, this event is just as bad as The First Edition.<br>I wrote double than I did my last ROBLOX event rant, and that one was also made with a lot of care.<br><br>Well... I guess that's it.<br>Surely they can't fuck up three times?]]>

    <title>WACUP is awesome.</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from a later March 2023 Blog Archive, has small changes, original blog has a last updated date of March 27th</small></p>
      <p>I was catching up on some SpaceHey just seeing what good stuff there was to read. I sometimes tend to do that, because I like reading dumb shit when I feel like it. In <strike>Athen</strike> Kam fashion, I ended up finding a rant about Winamp. Apparently they got into the Crypto scene, and it looked pretty ugly. Of course, I'm not a big fan of crypto stuff, so I decided "I guess that's another program gone".</p>
      <p>Well, I read through it, couldn't believe the bullshit about Winamp (which as of writing this, I'm uninstalling rn), and I noticed the guy actually linked this replacement called WACUP. It ran on a pretty stable build of WinAmp, added a lot of content, and expanded on it in a better way. I figured I'd give it a shot. If it was shit, well it's better than nothing. If it was good, I'd main it. Well, I downloaded it and decided to see what it was made of.</p>
      <p>God damn, it was fun installing it when I got the time.</p>
      <p>First off, the amount of extra features compared to the build I had previously (and now regret) installing, was kind of amazing. Already at the "check the features you want" phase, I was just trying to process what everything did. It felt way bigger than any other build of WinAmp, and it was almost like a new product. Credits to the WACUP team for all that shit they managed to cram in there, anyway.</p>
      <p>Installed it, and still pretty amazed. I can't tell if they did changes to the setup portion, but if they did they did it alright. Had fun picking out a theme and stuff. Setting everything up was as fun, I was playing with the Discord presence thing for the past 10 minutes, it was fun. Had to manually reinstall the Last.fm scrobbler plugin, but that wasn't too hard.</p>
      <p>I'm playing with it right now. All the themes and plugins they've slammed into this thing is kind of funny. I could mess with this thing for a few hours. But hey, it works exactly for what I needed Winamp and Foobar2000 for: A music player that has Discord Rich Presence and scrobbles to Last FM.</p>]]>

    <title>Technology is Like Magic</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from March 2023 Blog Archive; extra line + expanded dialog on one line + image added 09/08/24</small></p>
      <p>Windows computers are quite possibly the most confusing and most magical thing to ever exist. No, this doesn't cover windows modifications, or technical depth. Just how I saw it.</p>
      <p>This entry is more so about my own experiences. The good, the bad, and the downright confusing. Now keep in mind, I've used technology since I was maybe 5. So I have both some stories on crazy, awesome things Windows has done, some really broken things that happened, and some confusing things it's done, as well as some bonus stories from my childhood related to technology. Yep, a full length blog again. Let's go.</p>
      <p>Let's start with some good Windows has done. Build some character, to make the smashdown a little more exciting. Well, to start, backwards compatibility is sometimes like good. Like REALLY good, obviously issues but most of the time it's flawless. At the most, I've had issues with certain GameHouse (remember that old game website? Where you used to buy Plants vs Zombies, maybe?) titles, at the worst. Though sometimes the issues aren't as bad, like simply just having some flippy fullscreen on Halo: Combat Evolved. Although there's definitely way worse, like folder detection with some games, but note how compatibility is mostly preserved!</p>
      <p>Other than Compatiblity, there's also, at least in my opinion, how older versions of Windows handled logging in. Windows 8 & 8.1 (2012 & 2014 respectively) and after has a kind of funky user change system, and I'm not a fan of it. Although at Windows 7 (2009), it was pretty smooth, and I really liked how it used to be. </p>
      <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XZRO4LXYcp0/T2WPEZLjOQI/AAAAAAAAAT0/aaRRb8skcRo/s1600/Clone+of+Windows+7-2012-03-16-21-51-12.png" alt="Windows 7 login screen" class="small right">
      <p>If you're unfamiliar, or you just never got to experience a computer before, it looked about like this:</p>
      <p>Yeah, there was that nice blue background, and all of the users were displayed in columns. You'd click one, enter your password if you wanted, and you'd be on your way. On Windows 8 and after, you see the first user, and you have to manually switch to another user in the login menu, which I don't like. And my device actually automatically logs into the correct user, which I'm not complaining, cause I don't use the other user on it, lol. Still though, imagine that happening to somebody else's account. Pretty annoying.</p>
      <p>But Windows 7 had this simple design. And it looked pretty nice. Vista (2007)'s was near the same, just with a green and blue gradient instead.</p>
      <img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MC-zuKZe02q5nfiMimSwqXKYVCI=/1250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/windows-xp-safe-mode-login-5a679bd7eb97de001a76647e.PNG" alt="Windows XP login screen" class="small right">
      <p>I cannot for the life of me find a good screenshot, so instead here's one of Windows XP, released around 2001:</p>
      <p>Looks nice, don't it? If only Windows 8 and later was as simple as that. It would have been a nice thing to have, to be able to enjoy a more legacy login screen. Instead we have modern looking junk, and I think everybody knows what the Windows 10 login screen looks like.</p>
      <img src="http://www.wikihow.com/images/1/13/Login-to-Windows-XP-as-the-Administrator-Step-2.jpg" alt="Windows legacy login screen" class="small right">
      <p>There's also a variant for nerds! Here's what that looks like:</p>
      <p>Alright, let's talk about the bad now. I think Performance is a good first thing to put on the table here, because I have a LOOOOOOOOOT to talk about when it comes to performance.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the lack of care. Windows 10 and beyond were designed for SSDs, it's clear it is if you've ever run windows on an HDD, like I am right now, you can just TELL how bad it is. Like you can FEEL how painful it is if you used one before. The constant pausing, the constant crashing of the file explorer, the consistent input lag, etc... You really begin to despite the OS. Even more when your manufacturer thinks it's fucking genius to put an HDD and Windows 10 64-bit together. Yeah.</p>
      <p>Oh, I'm not done. Obviously not. Would you like to talk about the fact that a bug with memory cleaning STILL exists in Windows 11? Yes, I'm fucking serious, In Windows 10, there is a bug where the memory doesn't clean itself. It causes stuttering in games like Assassin's Creed: Origins, Battlefield 1, and it affects both Intel and AMD CPUs. No seriously, there's reddit posts from like 4 years ago (2018 and before) about this shit. It's stupid. </p>
      <p>On top of THAT, it's also a NIGHTMARE to work with other software sometimes. A program I use for controlling CPU/GPU fan speeds and clock literally DOESN'T EVEN WORK. If I reinstall windows without using the "Reset this PC" function, IT CANNOT BE PROPERLY INSTALLED AGAIN. If I try to uninstall it and entirely re-install it, IT CANNOT BE PROPERLY INSTALLED AGAIN. If I completely format my hard drive? You guessed it, CANNOT be properly installed again.</p>
      <p>Like this is a joke. It can't even update without erroring out all the time. Asus has the WORST OEM software I have ever used for a program, and I used to have an HP Laptop. I also used to literally run games that barely met the MINIMUM specs on a Compaq Scenario from 2007. And a 2020 laptop can barely last 5 minutes in the OS. Like???</p>
      <p>Although, the confusing is very short. Sometimes, the OS can magically repair itself. For example, explorer took 10 straight minutes to start after uninstalling a Windows 11 update. Starting the computer the next day, and it's the regular speeds. Sometimes it'd co-operate it, other times it'd randomly lock up random apps whenever it wants. Performance hacks that worked one day, might not another, then suddenly work again the third day. Etcetera, Etcetera, Etcetera.</p>
      <p>Yeah, Windows is kind of a wild one. But why not end it off with a story?</p>
      <p>I used to be pretty crazy of a computer user when I was young. I had once come across this thing, basically a YouTube video of about several shitty bat files you could make and you could call yourself a hacker for knowing how to make them or something. Well, one made about a thousand folders, and named them by numbers. I thought that was funny, so I did it on the desktop, and hid each one in a folder. So you'd go to one folder, you'd see 7, go to another, see 4, go to another, only see 2, etc. My parents didn't like that too much, but I thought it was cool. They were probably mad about it, but it was worth it for the laugh LOL.</p>
      <p>Until next post.</p><br>
      <p>Edit: Would you look at that, Windows forcing 100% of my CPU to be used at all times! I don't remember setting that, I sure wonder what's going on...
More proof Windows does what it wants! Spooky...</p>]]>

    <title>A Rant about Stick Aim</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from March 2023 Blog Archive</small></p>
      <p>Last I checked, I don't think my controller has gyro aim or anything, so this post is exclusively ranting about Stick Aim. Just clarifying.</p>
      <p>Stick aim makes me feel like I'm a god damn caveman. You ever just miss shots for no reason trying to find that enemy? You move too fast or too slow to catch up? It sucks. Yet I prefer movement and crouching on controller compared to keyboard and mouse. So it's like a complete priority shift... Kinda.</p>
      <p>It's like... Good god, isn't there a good in-between? Keyboard and Mouse works, yeah, but theoretically, is there at LEAST a good solution? Something cooler?</p>
      <p>Not really. I get the limitations, and most of the time it's fine, but Stick aim is just so unpolished, because of the lack of precision and it's just... ughhhh.</p>
      <p>Controller gaming just really sucks for shooters.</p>]]>

      <p>It's pretty late where I am, and I think I'm about to go to bed. But not before rambling about another thing: SpaceHey.</p>
      <p>I think Spacehey's like the first time I've been really interested in a social media platform. Probably because it's as easy as, say Twitter or Facebook to use. And it's more pleasant to use than both of those combined. After all, it works. It's functional, easy to use, and in my opinion, isn't overwhelming.</p>
      <p>Maybe because I'm a little nerdy. Maybe because the CSS customization strikes a little bit of my fancy. Maybe because it's just so reminiscent of MySpace, I want to see what I could have seen if I was born just 10-20 years earlier.</p>
      <p>Or maybe it's just because we're so used to being confined, confused, and beaten down by shitty, dysfunctional algorithms of modern day, SpaceHey is sort of an escape. An escape from the world of unideal and intrusive technology. Maybe it could be that, is why I use it?</p>
      <p>Honestly, nah. It's just a novelty. The features are cool, but you wanna know the real reason I love using it? <b>Meeting cool people who are like me.</b></p>
      <p>Alright, I'm off to bed. Thanks for listening. See you tomorrow.</p>]]>
