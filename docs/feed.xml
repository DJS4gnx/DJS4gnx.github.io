    <title>WACUP is awesome.</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from a later March 2023 Blog Archive, has small changes, original blog has a last updated date of March 27th</small></p>
      <p>I was catching up on some SpaceHey just seeing what good stuff there was to read. I sometimes tend to do that, because I like reading dumb shit when I feel like it. In <strike>Athen</strike> Kam fashion, I ended up finding a rant about Winamp. Apparently they got into the Crypto scene, and it looked pretty ugly. Of course, I'm not a big fan of crypto stuff, so I decided "I guess that's another program gone".</p>
      <p>Well, I read through it, couldn't believe the bullshit about Winamp (which as of writing this, I'm uninstalling rn), and I noticed the guy actually linked this replacement called WACUP. It ran on a pretty stable build of WinAmp, added a lot of content, and expanded on it in a better way. I figured I'd give it a shot. If it was shit, well it's better than nothing. If it was good, I'd main it. Well, I downloaded it and decided to see what it was made of.</p>
      <p>God damn, it was fun installing it when I got the time.</p>
      <p>First off, the amount of extra features compared to the build I had previously (and now regret) installing, was kind of amazing. Already at the "check the features you want" phase, I was just trying to process what everything did. It felt way bigger than any other build of WinAmp, and it was almost like a new product. Credits to the WACUP team for all that shit they managed to cram in there, anyway.</p>
      <p>Installed it, and still pretty amazed. I can't tell if they did changes to the setup portion, but if they did they did it alright. Had fun picking out a theme and stuff. Setting everything up was as fun, I was playing with the Discord presence thing for the past 10 minutes, it was fun. Had to manually reinstall the Last.fm scrobbler plugin, but that wasn't too hard.</p>
      <p>I'm playing with it right now. All the themes and plugins they've slammed into this thing is kind of funny. I could mess with this thing for a few hours. But hey, it works exactly for what I needed Winamp and Foobar2000 for: A music player that has Discord Rich Presence and scrobbles to Last FM.</p>]]>

    <title>Technology is Like Magic</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from March 2023 Blog Archive; extra line + expanded dialog on one line + image added 09/08/24</small></p>
      <p>Windows computers are quite possibly the most confusing and most magical thing to ever exist. No, this doesn't cover windows modifications, or technical depth. Just how I saw it.</p>
      <p>This entry is more so about my own experiences. The good, the bad, and the downright confusing. Now keep in mind, I've used technology since I was maybe 5. So I have both some stories on crazy, awesome things Windows has done, some really broken things that happened, and some confusing things it's done, as well as some bonus stories from my childhood related to technology. Yep, a full length blog again. Let's go.</p>
      <p>Let's start with some good Windows has done. Build some character, to make the smashdown a little more exciting. Well, to start, backwards compatibility is sometimes like good. Like REALLY good, obviously issues but most of the time it's flawless. At the most, I've had issues with certain GameHouse (remember that old game website? Where you used to buy Plants vs Zombies, maybe?) titles, at the worst. Though sometimes the issues aren't as bad, like simply just having some flippy fullscreen on Halo: Combat Evolved. Although there's definitely way worse, like folder detection with some games, but note how compatibility is mostly preserved!</p>
      <p>Other than Compatiblity, there's also, at least in my opinion, how older versions of Windows handled logging in. Windows 8 & 8.1 (2012 & 2014 respectively) and after has a kind of funky user change system, and I'm not a fan of it. Although at Windows 7 (2009), it was pretty smooth, and I really liked how it used to be. </p>
      <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XZRO4LXYcp0/T2WPEZLjOQI/AAAAAAAAAT0/aaRRb8skcRo/s1600/Clone+of+Windows+7-2012-03-16-21-51-12.png" alt="Windows 7 login screen" class="small right">
      <p>If you're unfamiliar, or you just never got to experience a computer before, it looked about like this:</p>
      <p>Yeah, there was that nice blue background, and all of the users were displayed in columns. You'd click one, enter your password if you wanted, and you'd be on your way. On Windows 8 and after, you see the first user, and you have to manually switch to another user in the login menu, which I don't like. And my device actually automatically logs into the correct user, which I'm not complaining, cause I don't use the other user on it, lol. Still though, imagine that happening to somebody else's account. Pretty annoying.</p>
      <p>But Windows 7 had this simple design. And it looked pretty nice. Vista (2007)'s was near the same, just with a green and blue gradient instead.</p>
      <img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MC-zuKZe02q5nfiMimSwqXKYVCI=/1250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/windows-xp-safe-mode-login-5a679bd7eb97de001a76647e.PNG" alt="Windows XP login screen" class="small right">
      <p>I cannot for the life of me find a good screenshot, so instead here's one of Windows XP, released around 2001:</p>
      <p>Looks nice, don't it? If only Windows 8 and later was as simple as that. It would have been a nice thing to have, to be able to enjoy a more legacy login screen. Instead we have modern looking junk, and I think everybody knows what the Windows 10 login screen looks like.</p>
      <img src="http://www.wikihow.com/images/1/13/Login-to-Windows-XP-as-the-Administrator-Step-2.jpg" alt="Windows legacy login screen" class="small right">
      <p>There's also a variant for nerds! Here's what that looks like:</p>
      <p>Alright, let's talk about the bad now. I think Performance is a good first thing to put on the table here, because I have a LOOOOOOOOOT to talk about when it comes to performance.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the lack of care. Windows 10 and beyond were designed for SSDs, it's clear it is if you've ever run windows on an HDD, like I am right now, you can just TELL how bad it is. Like you can FEEL how painful it is if you used one before. The constant pausing, the constant crashing of the file explorer, the consistent input lag, etc... You really begin to despite the OS. Even more when your manufacturer thinks it's fucking genius to put an HDD and Windows 10 64-bit together. Yeah.</p>
      <p>Oh, I'm not done. Obviously not. Would you like to talk about the fact that a bug with memory cleaning STILL exists in Windows 11? Yes, I'm fucking serious, In Windows 10, there is a bug where the memory doesn't clean itself. It causes stuttering in games like Assassin's Creed: Origins, Battlefield 1, and it affects both Intel and AMD CPUs. No seriously, there's reddit posts from like 4 years ago (2018 and before) about this shit. It's stupid. </p>
      <p>On top of THAT, it's also a NIGHTMARE to work with other software sometimes. A program I use for controlling CPU/GPU fan speeds and clock literally DOESN'T EVEN WORK. If I reinstall windows without using the "Reset this PC" function, IT CANNOT BE PROPERLY INSTALLED AGAIN. If I try to uninstall it and entirely re-install it, IT CANNOT BE PROPERLY INSTALLED AGAIN. If I completely format my hard drive? You guessed it, CANNOT be properly installed again.</p>
      <p>Like this is a joke. It can't even update without erroring out all the time. Asus has the WORST OEM software I have ever used for a program, and I used to have an HP Laptop. I also used to literally run games that barely met the MINIMUM specs on a Compaq Scenario from 2007. And a 2020 laptop can barely last 5 minutes in the OS. Like???</p>
      <p>Although, the confusing is very short. Sometimes, the OS can magically repair itself. For example, explorer took 10 straight minutes to start after uninstalling a Windows 11 update. Starting the computer the next day, and it's the regular speeds. Sometimes it'd co-operate it, other times it'd randomly lock up random apps whenever it wants. Performance hacks that worked one day, might not another, then suddenly work again the third day. Etcetera, Etcetera, Etcetera.</p>
      <p>Yeah, Windows is kind of a wild one. But why not end it off with a story?</p>
      <p>I used to be pretty crazy of a computer user when I was young. I had once come across this thing, basically a YouTube video of about several shitty bat files you could make and you could call yourself a hacker for knowing how to make them or something. Well, one made about a thousand folders, and named them by numbers. I thought that was funny, so I did it on the desktop, and hid each one in a folder. So you'd go to one folder, you'd see 7, go to another, see 4, go to another, only see 2, etc. My parents didn't like that too much, but I thought it was cool. They were probably mad about it, but it was worth it for the laugh LOL.</p>
      <p>Until next post.</p><br>
      <p>Edit: Would you look at that, Windows forcing 100% of my CPU to be used at all times! I don't remember setting that, I sure wonder what's going on...
More proof Windows does what it wants! Spooky...</p>]]>

    <title>A Rant about Stick Aim</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from March 2023 Blog Archive</small></p>
      <p>Last I checked, I don't think my controller has gyro aim or anything, so this post is exclusively ranting about Stick Aim. Just clarifying.</p>
      <p>Stick aim makes me feel like I'm a god damn caveman. You ever just miss shots for no reason trying to find that enemy? You move too fast or too slow to catch up? It sucks. Yet I prefer movement and crouching on controller compared to keyboard and mouse. So it's like a complete priority shift... Kinda.</p>
      <p>It's like... Good god, isn't there a good in-between? Keyboard and Mouse works, yeah, but theoretically, is there at LEAST a good solution? Something cooler?</p>
      <p>Not really. I get the limitations, and most of the time it's fine, but Stick aim is just so unpolished, because of the lack of precision and it's just... ughhhh.</p>
      <p>Controller gaming just really sucks for shooters.</p>]]>

    <title>SpaceHey: A Ramble</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from March 2023 Blog Archive</small></p>
      <p>It's pretty late where I am, and I think I'm about to go to bed. But not before rambling about another thing: SpaceHey.</p>
      <p>I think Spacehey's like the first time I've been really interested in a social media platform. Probably because it's as easy as, say Twitter or Facebook to use. And it's more pleasant to use than both of those combined. After all, it works. It's functional, easy to use, and in my opinion, isn't overwhelming.</p>
      <p>Maybe because I'm a little nerdy. Maybe because the CSS customization strikes a little bit of my fancy. Maybe because it's just so reminiscent of MySpace, I want to see what I could have seen if I was born just 10-20 years earlier.</p>
      <p>Or maybe it's just because we're so used to being confined, confused, and beaten down by shitty, dysfunctional algorithms of modern day, SpaceHey is sort of an escape. An escape from the world of unideal and intrusive technology. Maybe it could be that, is why I use it?</p>
      <p>Honestly, nah. It's just a novelty. The features are cool, but you wanna know the real reason I love using it? <b>Meeting cool people who are like me.</b></p>
      <p>Alright, I'm off to bed. Thanks for listening. See you tomorrow.</p>]]>
