    <title>A Rant about Stick Aim</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from March 2023 Blog Archive</small></p>
      <p>Last I checked, I don't think my controller has gyro aim or anything, so this post is exclusively ranting about Stick Aim. Just clarifying.</p>
      <p>Stick aim makes me feel like I'm a god damn caveman. You ever just miss shots for no reason trying to find that enemy? You move too fast or too slow to catch up? It sucks. Yet I prefer movement and crouching on controller compared to keyboard and mouse. So it's like a complete priority shift... Kinda.</p>
      <p>It's like... Good god, isn't there a good in-between? Keyboard and Mouse works, yeah, but theoretically, is there at LEAST a good solution? Something cooler?</p>
      <p>Not really. I get the limitations, and most of the time it's fine, but Stick aim is just so unpolished, because of the lack of precision and it's just... ughhhh.</p>
      <p>Controller gaming just really sucks for shooters.</p>]]>

    <title>SpaceHey: A Ramble</title>
    <description>
<![CDATA[<p><small>Backported from March 2023 Blog Archive</small></p>
      <p>It's pretty late where I am, and I think I'm about to go to bed. But not before rambling about another thing: SpaceHey.</p>
      <p>I think Spacehey's like the first time I've been really interested in a social media platform. Probably because it's as easy as, say Twitter or Facebook to use. And it's more pleasant to use than both of those combined. After all, it works. It's functional, easy to use, and in my opinion, isn't overwhelming.</p>
      <p>Maybe because I'm a little nerdy. Maybe because the CSS customization strikes a little bit of my fancy. Maybe because it's just so reminiscent of MySpace, I want to see what I could have seen if I was born just 10-20 years earlier.</p>
      <p>Or maybe it's just because we're so used to being confined, confused, and beaten down by shitty, dysfunctional algorithms of modern day, SpaceHey is sort of an escape. An escape from the world of unideal and intrusive technology. Maybe it could be that, is why I use it?</p>
      <p>Honestly, nah. It's just a novelty. The features are cool, but you wanna know the real reason I love using it? <b>Meeting cool people who are like me.</b></p>
      <p>Alright, I'm off to bed. Thanks for listening. See you tomorrow.</p>]]>
