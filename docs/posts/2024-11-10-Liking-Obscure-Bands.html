      <p>Just want to know if anybody suffers like this, especially if you have more obscure taste. Like say you know an artist and you really like their music, or find you can't find anybody who likes that artist?<br><br>
        
        Like I like Normandie. That's a pretty solid Alternative Rock band with about 50k listeners on Spotify and 100k on last.fm, as far as I remember. Okay cool, but I can't find any fans of that band in the wild :(<br><br>
        
        There's going to be way more bands out there, even if it's as much of a cult hit as FEX or even an obscure, basically unheard of act like Ryan Willen. But what other bands are like this, where you find it hard to find fans of their work?</p>
