      <p>So literally an hour ago, the band behind the most mysterious song on the internet, FEX, just made a YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgKKcz5sjSY" target="_self">and uploaded their famous song</a> today. It's surreal knowing this little song was discovered and identified, let alone the driving force of thousands of people, all coming from a simple mid 80s song that didn't have a name to it for so long.

        <br><br>This is the millionth post about it, the millionth report but hear me out.<br><br>
        
        I'm not going to deny that there's flaws with this song. The drums are a tiny bit quiet to my ears, and it's clear from the audio quality that the song is pretty old. But such a simple song, good or bad, can connect a lot of people. The stories of people who say this song helped them through hardships is big, and the song isn't even terrible. It's actually pretty good!<br><br>
        
        The fact that after 17 years, we found the band who recorded it, and now they're even willingly sharing what they know? That's an impressive feat. And a really wholesome victory as well, and this is kinda what this song deserved. A victory lap.<br><br
        
        >We might not have Darius' version, but we have the song nonetheless. And in full. We should be glad we have this wonderful song at all! And the way it's touched many people is such a nice thing.<br><br>
        
        It's a look into the subways of one's mind.<br>
        I don't know what to say. :p<br></p>
