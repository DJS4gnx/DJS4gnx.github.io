    <p>web development is something i never learnt</p>
    <p><a href="/blog">check out my blog here</a>! (mirrors my <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/djsng">spacehey blog</a> on a delay)</p>
    <p><a href="/archive">if you wanted to see something i could actually make, check out the site archive! i compiled my old sites here</a></p>
    <p><br>also, all source code to this site is available on <a href="https://github.com/DJS4gnx/DJS4gnx.github.io">github</a> to comply with open source licenses, and just to give you the idea of how bad of a programmer i am. you can view this source in your browser, so might as well say right now it's free to crack open!<br>
    I am so sorry if you witness any war crimes</p>
