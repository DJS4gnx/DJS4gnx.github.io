                    <p>Hi! This small page serves the purpose of documenting my history, kind of like a portfolio to show the kind of stuff I've done overtime. It's a near full documentation of the many phases I had on the internet, as well as my various projects. This page is heavily inspired by <a href="https://wintr.neocities.org/creations">Wintr's "my creations" page</a>, so do please check that out too!</p>

                        <summary style="font-size: 20px;">This Website</summary>
                        <p>So, this website... It has a very interesting history. When it comes to before Neocities, I actually kind of already experimented with a personal website, though mostly to shitpost with friends. In November 2020, I was doing test stuff with HTML that was entirely unstyled, basically some junk. It was a small little project, nothing special.</p>
                        <p>Starting from about 2021 through 2023, I copied the code of the abandoned 2010 website MetalMIDIs, a 2010s site that hosted MIDIs of songs by Metalica, Slayer, and a bunch of other "your dad" metal bands. This isn't really a blog post, so I won't explain what a MIDI is, you should look on your own time. But basically, it kind of sounds like the song, but it's also really small.</p>
                        <p>So around April 2021, I created the first version of my website, a crappy modification of Metal MIDIs. At the time, there were two rivaling sites (both domains dead! please do not visit them) -- Mine, woodacadweb.cf; and my friend's, wwwdotwebsite.onthewifi.com. We once had a minibeef that was completely unserious, which involved reuploading and showing publically on wwwdotwebsite's homepage, some old Doki Doki Literature Club gameplay. I'm completely serious, this <i>was</i> a shitpost project. So that was a harmless minibeef. </p>
                        <p>The whole site served the purpose of just being a shitpost. It was kind of serious at times, sometimes serious in it's execution, but most of the time I didn't really care about how I came off. We weren't taking ourselves seriously at all.</p>
                        <p>My first discovery of Neocities was in When I came around to Neocities around 2022, when I discovered it through some friends and wanted to have an alternative for when envitably I'd lose korephase.cf. After trying to upload my site, I had a bad time and just... quit. Fast forward to 2024, after also having picked up the Goblin Heart layout generator and giving up on it once already, I gave it a second chance following an incident in my friend group. My first design that stuck was the <a href="./archive/xamp24">grey version</a> of the three Goblin heart sites I made. The third of course is the <a href="./archives/vido">Vido blue one</a> and the first one is lost, because I don't know anything about it. I rocked the grey site a while before losing disinterest again for a while.</p>
                        <p>Around September 2024, I picked back up the idea of making a site and made a temporary plaintext domain not long before I picked up the Goblin Heart template... again. After some tweaks, <a href="./archives/vido">I turned it blue</a> and after some button collecting, I went on my <i>proper</i> personal website journey with Neocities... </p>
                        <p>At least before nuking my website in November on a crash out over a former friend in November. But I came back around, as around about March 2025, I returned, picked up a Kalechips layout after slacking on a GitHub Pages plaintext ugly mess for a while. For a good while, my 2025 GitHub pages was mostly just an archive, but after picking up a Kalechisp archive, adding some archives... here we are. A journal page and this wonderful yap to go!</p>

                        <p>It is very little surprise that I am a ROBLOX Rendering artist. It mainly started to just give it a shot, and over time, I slowly taught myself the ropes kind of like I did with Music producing. With the help of a friend I knew, I worked with and mastered lighting, made my own photo edits, and currently, I have a somewhat sizable experience.</p>

                        <summary style="font-size: 20px;">Music Production (with Beepbox)</summary>
                        <p>Creating music was always an interesting thing to me. When I was 8, I recorded myself trying to sing to "The Monster" by Eminem, a recording I somehow still have thanks to it surviving on a USB that was owned by my stepfather. That said USB is permanently stuck in read-only for unknown reasons, and its casing is long gone.</p>
                        <p>I kind of knew off the bat that I was probably not meant to be a singer. I'm awkward, fucked up my lines, and I personally think I'm an awful sounding singer. But what if I just made the beat instead of the vocals?</p>
                        <p>My production journey was a long and self-taught one. I went in knowing basically nothing, only barely teaching myself by just making whatever sounded good. With the Chiptune engine <a href="https://beepbox.co">Beepbox</a>, it was trivial to be able to just spam click to make a tune. However, since about September 2022, I wanted to try and start making stuff more genuine, and more cleverly thought out. I spent 2023 trying to improve, and while I was still rusty and making repetitive tracks, I still made good melodies. With the assistance of a former friend, the artwork was handled, the production was handled, I'd taught myself very rough mixing... So all I had to do was grind to improve for a few years.</p>
                        <p>By 2024, there was definitely improvement! 2022 was mostly goofing off and thinking about if I wanted to do this forever, and trying to figure out what I doing. 2023 was mostly an extension of 2022, but rather than shotty melodies, some good stuff came to light. 2024 basically took that and threw it out the window, and while early 2024 was just 2023 with a bit of more flavor, by summer 2024, my quality began to go up. Getting ambitious with ideas like remixing a Beethoven song among other things, I began to just try more and more and became obessed with new ideas.</p>
                        <p>In the modern day, I'm currently experimenting with samples and some other ambitious ideas. I have yet to leave the Beepbox space of things.</p>
