                    <p>Hi! This small page serves the purpose of documenting my history, kind of like a portfolio to show the kind of stuff I've done overtime. It's a near full documentation of the many phases I had on the internet, as well as my various projects. This page is heavily inspired by <a href="https://wintr.neocities.org/creations">Wintr's "my creations" page</a>, so do please check that out too!</p>

                        <summary style="font-size: 20px;">This Website</summary>
                        <p>So, this website... It has a very interesting history. When it comes to before Neocities, I actually kind of already experimented with a personal website, though mostly to shitpost with friends. I used to experiment with XAMPP and the idea of self-hosting, which would be knowledge that would help me a lot later on in life. I may have only been 13 and blindly forwarding ports, but at the least, I didn't put myself in too much risk. I hope...<br> In November 2020, I was doing test stuff with HTML that was entirely unstyled, which was mostly a junk thing. It was my first ever attempt at a website, where I knew nothing about styles, nothing about more than the paragraph HTML tag, etc. It was as barebones as you can imagine.</p>
                        <p>In 2021 I copied the code of the abandoned 2010 website MetalMIDIs, a 2010s site that hosted MIDIs of songs by Metalica, Slayer, and a bunch of other "your dad" metal bands. This isn't really a blog post, so I won't explain what a MIDI is, you should look on your own time. But basically, it kind of sounds like the song, but it's also really small.<br>Basically, the culture of my 2021-2023 site revolved around code I stole from a 2010s site, and it started because my friend did it and I wanted to do the same thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>I created the first version of my website around April 2021, where this version of the site would last until Summer 2023. It was a very crappy modification of Metal MIDIs, with a "EmoMIDIs" joke even spawning from it, a response to my friend adding more MIDIs to their site...</p>
                        <p>Ah right, I should tell you about that. At the time, there were two rivaling sites (both domains dead! please do not visit them) -- Mine, woodacadweb.cf (later korephase.cf); and my friend's, wwwdotwebsite.onthewifi.com. We once had a minibeef that was completely unserious, which involved reuploading and showing publically on wwwdotwebsite's homepage, some old Doki Doki Literature Club gameplay. I'm completely serious, this <i>was</i> a shitpost project. So that was a harmless minibeef. </p>
                        <p>The whole site served the purpose of just being a shitpost. It was kind of serious at times, occasionally executing a good idea outside of the lowercase chaos and horribly unserious tone, but most of the time I didn't really care about how I came off. We weren't taking ourselves seriously at all.</p>
                        <p>My first discovery of Neocities was about 2022, when I discovered it through some friends and wanted to have an alternative for when envitably I'd lose korephase.cf. After trying to upload my site, I had a bad time and just... quit. I had also tried in 2023 to use it, using the Goblin Heart layout generator, but giving up coloring it after my puke forest green theme didn't work out.</p>
                        <p>Fast forward to 2024, after also having picked up the Goblin Heart layout generator and giving up on it once already, I gave it a second chance following an incident in my friend group. My first design that stuck was the <a href="./archive/xamp24">grey version</a> of the three Goblin heart sites I made. The third of course is the <a href="./archives/vido">Vido blue one</a> and the first one is lost, because I don't know anything about it. I rocked the grey site a while before losing disinterest again for a while.</p>
                        <p>Around September 2024, I picked back up the idea of making a site and made a temporary plaintext domain not long before I picked up the Goblin Heart template... again. After some tweaks, <a href="./archives/vido">I turned it blue</a> and after some button collecting, I went on my <i>proper</i> personal website journey with Neocities. I lead myself through many other templates, practically digging around other people's sites and borrowing some snippets of codes to play around. Eventually, when nomnomnami created her site templates, I jumped that train and went through two of her templates, before...</p>
                        <p>The great fire. I nuked my website on November 20th 2024 following a crash out over a former friend, who I had dropped after growing uncomfortable and being tired of their shenanigans. Luckily, all of the GitHub history was saved, so I recovered it all and put it here for everybody to see, but it was still a temporary loss.</p>
                        <p>But I came back around, as around about March 2025, I returned. Starting lazily with just plaintext for the first while of 2025, just an ugly plaintext site on GitHub Pages for my own amusement. Though, I kind of begun to miss having a site. So, after browsing around for some layouts and asking the Spacehey community for site help in May 2025, I picked up a Kalechips layout, skimmed through some resources for more help and dusted off my abandoned Neocities account. I cleaned up some archives, added a journal page based on Nami's wonderful Pastille template, and... Well, here we are, you're blessed with this yap. The fairy tale is over.</p>

                        <p>It is very little surprise that I am a ROBLOX Rendering artist. I don't mention it often, but I do post my work every once and a while. It might just be a  small sizable hobby, but it earns it's spot here for being relatively new, as well as being a blast to perfect.</p>
                        <p>It mainly started to just give it a shot. I was surrounded by people who did similar things, such as some beginner animators, some Roblox GFX artists, even a fellow rendering artist, who was the sole reason I wanted to also learn rendering. Though, their influence on me ended up being very negative and predatory. But hey, I didn't drop this hobby!</p>
                        <p>Over time, I slowly taught myself the ropes kind of like I did with Music producing. With the help of a friend I knew, I worked with Studio, slowly teaching myself the ideal positions, and slowly became comfortable with doing it on my own, trying not to rely too much on community feedback. I worked best I could to work with and master lighting and posing, often topping my renders up with my own photo edits, and currently, I have a somewhat sizable experience. I'm no genius, but I got a little bit of knowledge.</p>

                        <summary style="font-size: 20px;">Music Production (with Beepbox)</summary>
                        <p>Creating music was always an interesting thing to me. When I was 8, I recorded myself trying to sing to "The Monster" by Eminem, a recording I somehow still have thanks to it surviving on a USB that was owned by my stepfather. That said USB is permanently stuck in read-only for unknown reasons, and its casing is long gone.</p>
                        <p>I kind of knew off the bat that I was probably not meant to be a singer. I'm awkward, fucked up my lines, and I personally think I'm an awful sounding singer. But what if I just made the beat instead of the vocals?</p>
                        <p>My production journey was a long and self-taught one. I went in knowing basically nothing, only barely teaching myself by just making whatever sounded good. I had discovered the Chiptune engine <a href="https://beepbox.co">Beepbox</a> while looking for piano tools online, which begun to attract me. It was super easy to make music just by spamming mouse. But when I started thinking a little more about my tunes instead of just spamming... I knew that perhaps, I could consider making more genuine, cleverly thought out tracks. After hearing the work of fellow beeper <a href="https://smaz9.bandcamp.com/" title="Genuine shoutout. I LOVE YOUR WORK SO MUCH">Smaz</a> at some point in 2022, I knew I had to at least try and keep this hobby up.</p>
                        <p>I spent 2023 trying to improve, and I really tried. I might have been rusty, creating tracks that were repetitive and almost structureless, I still made good melodies. With the assistance of two former friends, the artwork was handled, the production was handled, I'd taught myself very rough mixing... So all I had to do was grind to improve for a few years.</p>
                        <p>By 2024, there was definitely improvement! 2022 was mostly goofing off and thinking about if I wanted to do this forever, and trying to figure out what I doing. 2023 was mostly an extension of 2022, but rather than shotty melodies, some good stuff came to light. 2024 basically took that and threw it out the window, and while early 2024 was just 2023 with a bit of more flavor, by summer 2024, my quality began to go up. Getting ambitious with ideas like remixing a Beethoven song among other things, I began to just try more and more and became obessed with new ideas.</p>
                        <p>In the modern day, I'm currently experimenting with samples and some other ambitious ideas. I have yet to leave the Beepbox space of things. While I mainly work alone when it comes to my artwork, I produce in a duo with a family member, trying to make more good things. I'm not the smartest producer around, but I'm still producing just for fun, after all.</p>

                        <summary style="font-size: 20px;">Lore Writing</summary>
                        <p>I tend to keep this one to myself since I'm not the most proudest of my work. I like to keep some of my writing pieces to myself, but every once and a while, if I feel I can trust the other person, I might just drop a bombshell of a worldbuilding piece.</p>
                        <p>Around 2021, during the peak of my Roleplay experience (which is talked more about later down this page), I begun experimenting with writing in between roleplay sessions. Prior to this point, most of the lore I wrote was mostly for reference. It had no use outside of adding context to Roleplay scenes, and it was mostly built off of existing roleplays that have all already happened. I still do that now -- I really like blending past and present. A little bit of real events in between the stuff I pre-decided.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, one of those things were experimenting with how my OC expressed himself. At the time, I decided on a cassette series, which was basically pre-written lore that explains some of the cassette audio tapes fellow roleplayers could find. It was a transcription style, very basic with the header just being the record date, the label on the tape physically, and the contents of the tape. I used to keep close track of what tape was what, and I cared a lot about consistency. Sometimes I'd have to make the tape concents up on the fly, but there's a few good tapes I made up in advance. One of those tapes was about my OC facing his alter ego, I think. Having a conversation about protection, while they were barricaded together in a bedroom. I don't quite remember.</p>
                        <p>Since then, I tried to expand my oppertunities. Nowadays, I nicknamed my new era, "The Red Sun Experiment". My writing serves as a filler until I find more Roleplay partners who are super active, I just write in between when I'm bored. I also sometimes use it to creative write and vent frustrations. Effective, surprisingly.</p>

                        <p>Similar to the reasons I had decided I wanted to do ROBLOX renders because a friend was doing it, I also wanted to do OC edits in CapCut. The way that worked is you would gather footage from many ROBLOX games, play a bunch of animations, and splice it all together. I started making some pretty shitty stuff in 2022, then from 2023-2025, it was a slow rise in quality.</p>
                        <p>This hobby died when my drive died June 9th, which basically marked the end of editing. I currently don't have plans to go back due to ROBLOX's increasing issues with moderation, as well as lack of reliable storage space to store it on.</p>
