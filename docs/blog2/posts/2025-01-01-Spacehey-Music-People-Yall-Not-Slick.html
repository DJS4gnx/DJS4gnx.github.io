      <p><small>post backported from <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=1357013">original spacehey post</a>, the date is a rough estimate<br>please do not target people you see here.</small></p>
      <p>i get it. you want to promote your work with the local community and untapped market of spacehey. that's fine! a lot of people don't like having ads put in their face and seeing promotions of other people's work, they may see it as an unwanted advertisement, or even just an invasion of what they came here for; making friends. those are kinds of people you probably wouldn't get engagement from no matter what you tried.</p>
      
      <p>there will be people who will eventually and naturally want to check out your work! usually you could do this by getting to know the person before showing them your work (AS I IMAGINE ANY PRODUCER WOULD, COUGH), which can sometimes be better on both ends! it's genuine interaction and it's a better way of getting somebody on the hook</p>
      
      <p>of course people will always be curious either way. i'm not gonna judge, but i'm saying that there's natural ways to make growth! and that's great<br>
        but please do not make it harder to opt out. please stop this.</p>
      
      <p>it should be common sense to allow somebody to not want to see you in their feeds, on their home page, etc. and that's normal, some people just don't like seeing seeing it at all, maybe they'll ease into it eventually. okay, well most accounts have friend request bots going. that's a little iffy, but you do what you want to do</p><p>but for those people who don't like that, there's always the option to just ignore and shut down this work! some people like space. <br></p>
      
      <p>but when you do stuff like <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/mmbj6o.png">this:</a><br><br>
        
        <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/mmbj6o.png" alt="note the lack of &quot;block&quot; or &quot;report&quot;"></p>
        
        <p>i even less want to check out your work.</p>
        
        <p>it takes maybe over 10 minutes to find out how to do this from scratch
            <br>it takes 5 minutes to make a profile
            <br>it takes no time at all to just allow me to block your account.</p>
            
            <p>i'll get into your work when i go looking for it.<br>please stop doing this kind of junk.<br>
                this is why people don't like music accounts.</p>
                
                <p>if you planned on making an account for your band, i'm going to be honest, either you'll have to either annoy everybody (you'll get blocked a lot but with enough patience you might get a following!) or you'll just have to hope somebody comes to you.</p>
                
                <p>even if you're not a band, just some producer who does it in his free time, that wants to get your creations out there</p>
                
                <p>please stop doing this one dimensional profile garble.</p>
                
                <p>nobody wants this.</p>
