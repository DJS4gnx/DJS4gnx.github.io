	<h1>A quick warning</h1>
	<p>Hi, Dj here. You have almost made it to my website!</p>
	<p>Before you visit, please <i>read carefully</i>. Firstly; this site is intended for those PG-13 (occasional swearing, no harmful content) and is meant to be overall lighthearted, excluding some rants with obvious negative (but harmless) implications. However, mature content intended for audiences over 18 that mention sexual topics, predatory behavior, and other sensitive topics may be present, <b>and is marked as clearly as possible</b>, gated behind at least two "open details" clicks or one "open post" click. 99% of the content you will see on this webpage will be appropiate for those 13 to 17, but I have done my hardest to hide mature content by clearly marking it as 18+ only. Recent events with one of my favorite video games requires talking about sexual themes, hence this warning. <b>I am trying my best to comply with all requests made by other websites.</b></p>
	<p>If you are uncomfortable interacting with 18+ content, have objections to this trigger/content warning, and/or have already been triggered, it is safe to close this tab and leave. There is no judgement. Please also do not interact and click away if you do not want to interact with people over 18.</p>
	<p>By explicitly choosing to not show any sexual images and limit the content to <b>only</b> dicussion, I've done enough to comply with Neocities' requirements to mark my page as 18+ <b>only</b> if I show lewd images. Since I do not show that content, I do not need to enable the 18+ filter. If Neocities' stance on inappropiate content shift, or more types of inappropiate content (including mentions) becomes outlawed, I will edit my site accordingly.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to know what content you may see, are a moderator from another site that needs to double check that what I put on this website is appropiate for your T&C and Site Rules, or are simply curious what brought me to make this decision, please click the widget below.</p>
	<p>TL;DR: <b>This site is SFW but some posts may include topics of predators and sexual themes. I marked these posts clearly as 18+.</b></p><hr>

			<summary>
				18+ content on this page - what to expect, some warnings, why I did this
			</summary>
				<p>I want to first make it clear <b>at most you will hear a sex joke or something with sexual themes <i>only when relevant</i></b>. There is no images, no audio, no sexually intentive content, only mentions. I try to be very sparing with 18+ content, especially because I have no plans of showing inappropiate content on a site that should be for PG-13 (excluding when inappropiate). However, I cannot remain clean all the time, so I have to put this warning here.</p>
				<p>There will very rarely be discussions of sexual content.
				<h3>What you may see</h3>
				<p>Some of the kinds of mature content you may expect to see when clicking on a mature post marked as for 18+ audiences only includes <b>sexual themes and topics</b> (mentions of with no visual or audio forms of sexual content, discussions about types of predators) and <b>other triggering content</b> (none at the moment)</p>
				<p>If this triggers you, remember that content with these topics are gated behind an extra few clicks. If you don't want to see it -- keep your finger off the left click button.</p>
				<h3>What to expect</h3>
				<p>Here are some examples of phrases and topics you may expect from posts marked as mature. Keep in mind that usually, posts marked 18+ will not be the center topic of these kinds of discussions, <b>just a few mentions, or a small section of the post</b>.<br>
					* Predators (in general) - "As it turns out, he was exposed to be a romantic fan of kids."<br>
					* Children being in the presence of predators - "The fact that pedophiles are allowed in the same spaces as kids..."<br>
					* Mentions (with no audio or visual content) of Sexual Content - ROBLOX is a sexual content hellscape.<br>
					<p>Remember that this content is gated by at least one click. You will rarely see this in normal browsing.</p>
					<h3>Why did I do this?</h3>
                <p>Due to ongoing, glaring issues with ROBLOX's moderation, as well as the nature of these issues being mature themes that are 18+, <b>I have begun marking some posts as 18+ hidden behind a few clicks</b> to comply with Neocities' "18+ pages have to go under a separate browse page if they include lewd/gross images" policy and many other webpages disallowing sexual content, very specifically images. Since they are only mentions and discussions without malicious intent, I've left the 18+ options on Neocities turned off, but I'll turn it on if the rules ever change.<br><br>
                This kind of content will be mentioned and lightly discussed a few times if I have to mention it to complete a blog post (i.e: Issues with ROBLOX's sexual content crisis), but otherwise you will never hear about sexual topics. Just avoid anything about ROBLOX and you'll be fine.</p>
