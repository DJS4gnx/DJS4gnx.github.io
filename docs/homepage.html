      <h4>Homepage: Jericho's Tavern blog</h4><br>
      <p>Hi, welcome to the tavern! Please stay, no matter if you came for a drink, to hear a story, or even to reread every single thing I've written about! The tables are over here, please stay a while as we tell you some stories.</p>
      <p>This is my personal blog, I mainly use it to document cool things I remember about, such as topics I like to ramble about, some of my internet journies through things like Roleplay, making this website, and even some rants about stuff that went wrong. There's a mix of everything from angry rants to happy retrospectives. There's something here for everybody, and I just write to be passionate about my interests. This blog is alt text heavy, hover over images, links, and a whole bunch of other stuff for some extra humor and content! I like to add context to everything, and adding alt text helps. This decision was inspired by xkcd doing it with their comics.</p>
      <p>Some technical details include that I run everything through the Zonelets blog engine. This page will mirror with my <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/djsng">SpaceHey blog</a> as much as possible for parity, especially because I mainly use this page as an archive, while posting to SpaceHey right after it arrives here to get a little bit of interest.</p>
      <p>If you have an RSS reader, you can copy <a href="https://djsng/neocities.org/feed.xml">this link</a> to add it to your reader! It currently does not have time accuracy, but I'm working on it. I currently use <a href="https://kalechips.net/projects/layouts/">kalechips</a>' Zonelets style.css theme, but I'll look into some more options later. Thank you to everybody who's Zonelets projects I've added to my blog!</p>
