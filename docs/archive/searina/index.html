        <h1>Notice for Mobile Users</h1>
        <p>Sure, this site is <i>technically</i> usable on mobile, however the graphics have been tuned for desktop in mind, and may appear offcenter or otherwise off on mobile. Just keep that in mind!</p>
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hi. I'm Kam, and I run a Neocities page as a hobby, because I don't know anything about code but felt like picking it up anyway. I've always been fascinated by the idea of having my own website page, playing a lot with copy pasted stuff around 2020, but around 2023, I decided to stop and take my own take at an actual site from scratch. I sat over that idea for the past year, and here we are. An idiot who shares a birthday with Ty Dolla $ign has their own site. While this site isn't the best thing ever made, and it's pretty rough around the edges, I still made something passable, and it's good enough.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer about buttons, I may or may not be fully aware of the content on the sites of the buttons I add. While they are not explicit, I do add various site buttons for sites both cringy and splendid, you should take anything I add with a grain of salt and assume it was just a site I found if I haven't mentioned it before.</p>
        <p>I learnt site hosting and software self-hosting after experimenting with HTML and wanting to host my first Minecraft server. By then, my interest in technology was set in stone.<br>During October of 2023, I decided to pick Neocities up and made my first site, a simple plaintext page, there was almost nothing to it's name. Then I tried Sadgurl's layout editor and made a few different site designs with that. I almost stuck with it, until Nami posted some HTML templates...</p>

        <p>You probably didn't come just to gloss the homepage. You either came to see what I had to say, or you just want to know what I'm like. So, here you go.</p>
        <p>The main thing I do on this site is write blogs. Sure, this site also has a main use of telling people where I can be found and showing off how weird I am, but I love talking about things and always wanted to write a blog. I always talked a lot about the things I like, and even when I read out some of the things I talk about, people say I'd be really great at blog posting.</p>
        <p>Well, I do that now. I like to talk a lot about technology and I like to tell people what I like about things, sometimes even trying to make them aware of new opportunities and the cool workarounds on the internet. Sure, most of the time I post like I'm angry, but that's kind of just the style I write in, a bit of jokingly ranting. And if that's not your thing, there's a serious post every now and then. And if you don't like either of those... Who are you?</p>
        <p>Though if you want to stick around a little longer than that, let me tell you about me!</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>Apart from the obvious technology ramble, I've also been recently collecting CDs and ripping them to build a digital collection. I admit, I am a little bit of a pirate, coming from a household that used to pirate things by the masses, even back then. However, I do also appreciate a lot of people's works, having been interested in streaming services and distribution. Unreleased music too, the way some songs don't make the light of day intrigues me, because usually that's the artist's best work in most cases.<br>
                    Internet and it's history too, I like learning a thing or two about how communication and even how power users functioned back in the day. I'm not the best power user out there, but if you've heard the names Directory Opus and foobar2000, you probably know what kind of power I like to have over my stuff. Let me customize my computer how I want, god damnit!</p>
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>God, let me get STARTED on this topic!<br>
                    The fun part out of the way first, I've been learning music production. I'm not FL Studio genius, nor do I own FL (I wish I did), but starting from free online tools, I think I've found my calling for electronic music. I occasionally post my favorite demos for everyone to view, because I think that's just what's owed. Gatekeeping your work isn't always it!<br>
                    Not including my own works, I listen to almost any genre, mainly having been interested in rock, metal and other random genres, but I've recently been becoming increasingly interested in electronic and hip hop! <!-- <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/RainbowxChaser">My last.fm page is recommended if you want to learn more.</a> -->
                    </p>
                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p>I've been playing video games for a while, as far as I know. I've been playing a lot of Ultrakill lately, and I'm still continuing a ten year ROBLOX spree! I have also played a long list of video games, mostly from my steam library, or even from other sources... ;)<br>
                    I've tried VRChat, but considering I both do not have a mic and do not know many people who are willing to invite me to their play sessions, I slowed down. I used to be obsessed with Undertale and recently enjoyed Undertale Yellow a lot. I occasionally play Apex Legends and Overwatch but as a singleplayer title, I hate competitive games and avoid public lobbies as much as possible.<br>
                    Some other games that I've been fond of before includes No More Room in Hell, Falllout: New Vegas, The Quarry, and of course, Garry's Mod.
                    I've basically played a lot of games, so maybe you should reach out and ask me if I've played, since I often forget to put games here, lol.</p>
        <h2>Hello to my friends!</h2>
        <p>
            2025 dj here<br>
            all of these people were people i used to know or people who i didn't get along with. just keep moving
            </p>
        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>Original SEARINA template provided by <a href="https://nomnomnami.com">NomnomNami</a>!</p>
        <p>Older "Vido" version built from <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/" target="_blank">sadgrl's layout builder</a>, with some snippets from <a href="https://dogspit.nekoweb.org/">Dogspit</a> and the OG icon from <a href="https://nomnomnami.com">NomnomNami</a>'s KAIMA</p>
        <h2>Getting in Contact</h2>
                    <p>This is for both friends and people looking to inquire.<br>
                    The fastest to reach out is Discord, my username is ds4x_m, nothing after "m".<br>
                    If for some reason you cannot reach out through Discord, your second best bet is SpaceHey. I don't have a public email. If for whatever reason you don't have that either, sign the guestbook with your concern or comment on my Neocities profile.
                    </p>
