    <h1>The Archives</h1>
    <p>Hi, welcome to the archives! This page serves as like a backlog of stuff I used to make. This page uses the old Plaintext GitHub Pages styling, because I don't really care much about what this site looks like.</p>
    <p>I have made a lot of old sites over the years, and a lot of my archives often go to rot. So, I decided to put them here and open them up to the public! There's so many old archives, that I might as well open them for people who wanted to see the old stuff.<br>
        Keep in mind that all the domains here (with the exception of anything from NeoCities) are no longer owned by me -- <b>Please do not visit them.</b></p>
