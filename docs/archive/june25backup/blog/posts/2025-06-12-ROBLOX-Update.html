      <!-- Final Title: "Leaving ROBLOX: Relapse - A 10 day strike"-->
        <p>Before you say that the math is wrong: <b>I quit on the night of May 31st.</b> I couldn't get around to making the post until the 2nd of June, as you're probably thinking. And also, the post didn't get finished until the 5th.</p>
        <p>Hope that clears everything up.</p>

        <h1>We lasted ten days</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, it appears that I am no god. I lasted approximately ten days (roughly May 31st - June 11th) before having my second playsession. The first playsession, being a lag test (mid excuse, I know!). The second session has happened a while ago <small>June 11th @ 2:53PM EST</small> and it seems right now, my attempt to actually permanently quit ROBLOX. Since "Quitting" doesn't seem to be a fitting name anymore, we're just going to calling it "Striking", since I was more so really aggressive about ROBLOX when I was off the platform. It was more like striking and preaching, even if I wasn't really doing that.<br>
        That sounds dumb... We'll call it that anyway.</p>
        <h1>Why did it fail?</h1>
        <p>So we have the main message: <i>My attempt to quit failed</i>. But why?</p>
        <p>Well, tech ethics is a big part of it. Either you have to go out of your way to avoid every company or compromise but let a bunch of companies manipulate and bend you.<br>
          But that's a bit of an extreme way to put it. So we also have the fact that quitting something important will make it hard when you're just so familiar and accustomed to it.</p>
          <p>Plus, ROBLOX is a comfort game for me and many other people, so quitting something that I could always turn to tends to, well... Cause hell.</p>
          <p>But that's not entirely meaningful on it's own. So let's look at some stuff that very likely added together to contribute to my eventual halt on my journey. What made me come back, if you will.<br>
          There's no shame in coming back -- We just tried our hardest and did what we could. Let's see what made it hard.</p>
        <h2>Failure to properly block access</h2>
        <p>I'm mentioning this right out of the gate, because it's a huge problem that caused the spiral.</p>
        <p>I had told my friend group (the first to know I quit) that I had blocked access to roblox.com in my main computer. Unfortunately... The block did nothing. I didn't do it correctly, it seemed, so it ended up leading to me visiting the site every once and a while to check in on things. And then I caved.</p>
        <p>This one was probably my fault, considering the block worked fine last time I tried (all the way in 2023 to 2024), perhaps I had forgotten to enable the block? There was some kind of fault with the system I was using to block the site traffic, so... ROBLOX remained accessible, for reasons I might have to investigate later. Fun, what a great way to start off. Failed to properly do my own part.<br>
        It's not a big deal though, anybody could have made this mistake. Most people wouldn't bother to do this either, so I'm kind of alone.</p>
        <p>Plus, I had put it on myself for not doing it to all of my other devices. One device blocked from ROBLOX will do basically nothing to keep me off the site...</p>
        <h2>Complications ("Cold Turkey")</h2>
        <h2><small>a.k.a. "A Comfort Game"</small></h2>
        <p>This was coming.</p>
        <p>"Sometimes it's hard to quit cold turkey", an expression I had only heard about within 5 days of my strike. And that kind of thing really set in stone how cooked I was from the start. It's hard to quit something you're so accommodated to.</p>
        <p>This kind of fits with the points of "ROBLOX is too popular to drop easily" and "I'm alone in my journey to do something so bold", but this point is different too. When you turn to a game so frequently, it tends to become an old favorite. And old favorites are comfort games for a lot.<br>
        And it was hard to quit a cold turkey. Or however that expression goes.</p>
        <p>Point is, committment is hard. I was trying to distance from a game that gave me comfort because the kind of people who were on the platform were making me uncomfortable. And when trying to not hear about it, I heard about it more, and that spiralled in...</p>
        <p>Well, toxicity. And then it was just downhill from there. And then I tried to quit, it failed... Here we are.</p>
        <h2>I was the only one doing this</h2>
        <p>While not really seeming like a big deal, this was actually a really huge reason. When your friends are all on the same social media, and are very frequent on that social media, it becomes hard to drop that social media.<br>
        It is ten times worse when that is the only place you can reach them.</p>
        <p>In my case, I was pretty lucky. I already knew my friends on other platforms, so I could definitely reach them. But considering that ROBLOX was a frequent gaming choice for a lot of my friend groups, and was a part of a lot of my friends' average game session every day, this was just bound to go down.</p>
        <p>It's something I like to call the "Modern Social Media" problem. When you hook everybody on one thing, have nobody getting word loud enough to introduce everybody else to a perfect, hassle free alternative, have all the bigger alternatives to have a caveat or unintroduced feature of some kind, etc... You create a monopoly.<br>
          So when everybody wants to quit, there are no reasonable alternatives. It's either too complicated (a hassle for users who only used it casually), too basic, or not viable.<br><br>
        The modern Social Media problem.</p>
        <p>The same logic applies here, but specifically the fact that it's hard to leave. Because it's the same problem, just not the same circumstances. This is a video game. Video games tend to leave you coming back again and again.</p>
        <h2>Some other reasons</h2>
        <p>Since we went through the common reasons already, let's look at some potential reasons:<br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>ROBLOX's popularity</b> - This was bound to happen too. ROBLOX is a very big game, full of people of various backgrounds, skill levels, languages... So good luck quitting something with a super diverse userbase!</li>
            <li><b>The modern social media problem</b> - It's hard to turn away from things when the goal of platforms is to keep you on as long as possible. And that's worse when all your friends are on it.</li>
            <li><b>Exclusivity</b> - ROBLOX has several games that are only available, well... On ROBLOX. That's a toolkit thing.</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>Pretty much, this was bound to go wrong, considering how big of a company ROBLOX is, and just how large it's userbase is. That makes problems both trying to protest it's shitty userbase full of predators, <i>and</i> a bold attempt to step away. All these factors, it's no wonder I couldn't quit for long. But we at least made the point we can strike for a little while.</p>
        <h1>What now?</h1>
        <p>Oh, woe me... I must now hide into the planet for not keeping my promise, hiding forever as I swallow my pride and disappear into this woeful, pathetic planet and...<br>
        No, I'm just kidding.</p>
        <p>Considering the damage of how even purely being in the presence of a good portion of the ROBLOX userbase (mainly the bad people, just to clarify! I mean the very obviously sketchy people) drives me crazy, it looks like all I can do is hyper avoid interacting with a single human being or even in being in the same room with another person in a public enviornment... A hard job, but you do what you have to do. Sometimes you have to go to big lengths to avoid people.</p>
        <p>I just don't know what to do, I guess. I don't want to add plus one to a statistic, but I also don't want to abandon my favorite game. This was all more of an experiment than it was an actual effort.</p>
        <p>Maybe I can figure it out later down the line?</p>
