      <p>Nothing is permanent. A lesson that The Crew has taught many by now. Or literally any modern game owning platform. If you know, you know.<br>
    I need to get my hands dirty. It's been far too long since I've given some companies some flak, and it's not happening long enough. We already have ROBLOX on the dial...</p>
    <p>Oh yes, ROBLOX! Let's talk about how they:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enabled an inappropiate content epidemic by doing fuck all about people uploading adult items to the catalog, INCLUDING A VERY CERTAIN OBJECTS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BANNED ON UPLOAD?</li>
        <li>Privated an API that didn't need to be privated (which broke a lot of legacy projects off-site), with the excuse of preventing 'spam' (so I'm a spammer? Gladly!)</li>
    </ul>
      <p></p>We covered a lot of giants so far, who can we throw hands at next?</p>
      <p>Oh yeahh, Spotify! The same company that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Infamously pays artists like shit</li>
            <li>Started using AI for Wrapped in 2024</li>
            <li>Re-justified music piracy with shit updates after solving it in the late 2000s / early 2010s</li>
            <li>placeholder</li>
        </ul>
