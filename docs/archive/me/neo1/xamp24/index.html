                    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
                    <p>I'm Haley, and this is my website. I am an 18 year old student from Canada, and I use this site mainly as a way to update people on what I'm doing, so try not to expect much in terms of graphic design or portfolio work. This isn't a demonstration of my skill, after all, I made this for fun. <b>This domain does not connect you to game servers I own</b>, please send a private message about that instead. I currently use SpaceHey for blogs but may set up a little blog system here at some point. Like what I do? Feel free to bookmark!<p>
                    <p>I do some archival stuff as I do data hoard, and I am mostly playing games now, but my main thing is my music project R1TALIN, where I post electronic music, made with some Chiptune inspirations. I have also previously done ROBLOX modding stuff, although I'm not active in it anymore. I don't really have a public status page to catch up on anything, so either you should see my SpaceHey bulletins/blogs for that, or you should just reach out to me privately. I'll look into a on-site blog system soon, like RSS. I am currently not available to do any work for anybody at the moment. I'll let you know if that changes.</p>
                    <p>I do not have any way to purchase my music at the moment. If you would like to receive downloads for new music, please ask me privately, bandcamp free downloads are costly!</p>
                    <p>This site probably does not look too great, and I already know that. I will be looking into trying to make changes soon that should hopefully minimize the ugliness.</p>
                    <p>If you need to contact me, the easiest way to reach out is through Discord. My username is <b>driftzoner</b> and friend requests should be on. I am also very active on SpaceHey if you do not like Discord.<br>I curently do not have a public email and have no plans to get one any time soon, but I will look into it. Send your questions your way, I'll answer as soon as I can!</p>
