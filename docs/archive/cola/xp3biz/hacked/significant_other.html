 <h2>Limp Bizkit - Significant Other<br><br>

This album is how I feel everyday. <br><br>

Break Stuff really tells how I feel. People always come up to me asking for shit and I just dont 
give a fuck about what they want or their problems. Nobody is asking how I'm doing or if I'm ok so 
why the fuck should I care about their problems. And when these people do talk to eachother they 
always get in arguments and shit about the stupidest shit and it makes me so fucking annoyed. When 
I'm around these people I do feel like a maniac and wanna rip their fucking heads off with a 
chainsaw. <br><br>

Nookie is also a perfect description of how I feel. I wasn't born perfect, I have my flaws, yet 
that doesn't give people the right to look at me different, or treat me different. Nor can they 
laugh at me for my mistakes. Why they fuck do they think they're any better they're just a bunch 
of fucking dumbasses with nothing better to do than to laugh at me for things I can't change. So 
yeah they can stick it up their asses.<br><br>

I'm Broke describes the people that are around me. They ask for my shit or my cash like its 
nothing even though they put me down and mock me for who I am. Like what the fuck do they think? Do 
they think I'm gonna pay them to be friends with them and shit? They can fuck off to their atm 
they call a mom and get money from that slut. </h2>
