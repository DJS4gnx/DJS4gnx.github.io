      <!-- final blog post title: "Running Back to 7: The Wonders of Revert8Plus" -->
      <p>I'm sure you can remember from my <a>Technology is like Magic</a> post that I talked about old Windows systems. Windows 7 is one of those kind of systems now, as it was discontinued five years ago, an event I made a lost skit for. You know, I was sitting at home, eating doritoes when the phone rang... "Windows 7 is kil". No, it was unbelievable then.</p>
      <p>Nah, I'm fucking with you. We all saw this coming in Janurary 2020. I made the skit around Feburary to March 2020, actually. I think... It was around when the popups started coming up on my old 7 system!</p>
      <p>But that's not good for a blog post. Let's get right into the meat!</p>
      <h1>Windows 7's Iconic design</h1>
      <p>I love the design of 7. This is kind of no surprise considering it was one of my childhood operating systems, serving me for basically most of 2014 through 2021! There was a few hiccups from 2016-2017 where I picked up 10 instead and found it super slow, and even some hiccups in the early half of 2018, around before July.</p>
      <p>Of course, we have to ignore the one slipup when I installed XP on my main laptop with no drivers to work with (I think I tried to dualboot but installed XP last! Whoops), the many times I've installed Windows 10 on a machine that had specs of a Vista era machine, the many computers I've went through by doing reckless shit with it...</p>
      <p>But it was a system I loved. The aero glass was good looking, the taskbar was a memorable one, it had the last of the poppy, pretty design that a lot of people called "Fruitiger Aero", the simple system requirements...</p>
      <h1>Dead?</h1>
      <p>Dead. They killed it 5 years ago.</p>
