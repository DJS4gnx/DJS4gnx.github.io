      <!-- final blog post title: "Running Back to 7: The Wonders of Revert8Plus" -->
      <p>I'm sure you can remember from my <a>Technology is like Magic</a> post that I talked about old Windows systems. Windows 7 is one of those kind of systems now, as it was discontinued five years ago, an event I made a lost skit for. You know, I was sitting at home, eating doritoes when the phone rang... "Windows 7 is kil". No, it was unbelievable then.</p>
      <p>Nah, I'm fucking with you. We all saw this coming in Janurary 2020. I made the skit around Feburary to March 2020, actually. I think... It was around when the popups started coming up on my old 7 system!</p>
      <p>But that's not good for a blog post. Let's get right into the meat!</p>
      <h1>Windows 7's Iconic design</h1>
      <p>I love the design of 7. This is kind of no surprise considering it was one of my childhood operating systems, serving me for basically most of 2014 through 2021! There was a few hiccups from 2016-2017 where I picked up 10 instead and found it super slow, and even some hiccups in the early half of 2018, around before July.</p>
      <p>Of course, we have to ignore the one slipup when I installed XP on my main laptop with no drivers to work with (I think I tried to dualboot but installed XP last! Whoops), the many times I've installed Windows 10 on a machine that had specs of a Vista era machine, the many computers I've went through by doing reckless shit with it...</p>
      <p>But it was a system I loved. The aero glass was good looking, the taskbar was a memorable one, it had the last of the poppy, pretty design that a lot of people called "Fruitiger Aero", the simple system requirements...</p>
      <h1>Dead?</h1>
      <p>Dead. They killed it 5 years ago.</p>
      <p>Everybody knows what comes to dead things. A retro device might be fun when it first comes out, but it has to die one way or another when it ages. Stuff like game releases for a game console stopping, online services shutting down, companies locking propietary devices by bricking it when the hardware is no longer needed... All that stuff that comes to outdated devices.</p>
      <p>Of course, some devices stay legendary and become adored, even in death. The NES and SNES remain stamples of retro consoles, the Wii is still regularly modded, the 3DS might be freshly dead but has new life, the... Actually-</p>
      <h2>Yeah, but...</h2>
      <p>Fucking titlecard...</p>
      <p>Yeah, things die and go extinct, that sucks. But sometimes, people make revival projects to keep these things alive. For Operating Systems, that includes "Extended Kernels", projects to make modern programs work on the old operating systems. Stuff like the Vista Extended Kernel, OneCore for XP, Vxkey for 7...</p>
      <h1>That's no fun!</h1>
      <p>Yeah, but sometimes these projects have flaws. Some stuff isn't meant to be backwards compatible this way. It's not going to be smooth as Windows 10, where you just tell programs you're Windows 11. There's unexpected undeveloped APIs not having been ported yet, some systems just being unable to handle it, driver incompatibilities...</p>
      <p>And that just sucks.</p>
