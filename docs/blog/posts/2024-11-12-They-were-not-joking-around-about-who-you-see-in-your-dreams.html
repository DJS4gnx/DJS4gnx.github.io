      <p>A while back, I heard as a fun fact that when you're dreaming, the brain cannot make up people from the ground up, so the brain presents you with people you have already seen and known. I thought nothing of it, figuring I don't dream enough to think about it.<br><br>

        Oh boy, that was so wrong. I forgot what my dream was about last night, but I can literally remember the face of a former high school friend and even my ex being the faces of some of the people in my dream? Like I could point and recognize those people, but they seemed really out of place because in the dream they were different people than they actually were like? If that makes sense?<br><br>

        And now I'm a little disappointed now, because I haven't talked to both of those faces in years. One of them changed for the worst and the other kind of disappeared from my friend group out of nowhere and I don't know how they're doing or anything. Makes me wish they were still around.</p>
