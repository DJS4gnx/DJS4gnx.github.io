      <!-- Final Title: "Leaving ROBLOX: Relapsed - A 10 day strike"-->
        <p>Before you say that the math is wrong: <b>I quit on the night of May 31st.</b> I couldn't get around to making the post until the 2nd of June, as you're probably thinking. And also, the post didn't get finished until the 5th.</p>
        <h1>We lasted ten days</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, it appears that I am no god. I lasted approximately ten days (roughly May 31st - June 11th) before having my second playsession. The first playsession, being a lag test. The second session has happened today (as of 2:53PM EST) and it seems right now, it's the end of the line for dropping ROBLOX, at least for now. Since "Quitting" doesn't seem to be a fitting name, we're just going to calling it "Striking", since I was more so really aggressive about ROBLOX when I was off the platform.</p>
        <h1>Why did it fail?</h1>
        <p>So we have the main message: <i>The striking failed</i>. But why?</p>
        <p>Well, considering there's multiple point of failures... I can only guess that a multitude of issues contributed to my inability to keep this up. Quitting something so important tends to make it hard. As we all know, tech ethics is hell. Either you have to go out of your way to avoid everything convenient or accept that you will have to compromise on a bunch of companies who will, well, take your blood and wipe their corkboards with it.</p>
        <p>Let's look at some stuff that probably contributed to my eventual coming back. There's no shame in it -- just that we tried our hardest.</p>
        <h2>Failure to properly block access</h2>
        <p>I'm mentioning this right out of the gate, because it's a huge problem that caused the spiral.</p>
        <p>I had told my friend group (the first to know I quit) that I had blocked access to roblox.com in my main computer. Unfortunately... The block did nothing. I didn't do it correctly, it seemed, so it ended up leading to me visiting the site every once and a while to check in on things. And then I caved.</p>
        <p>This one was probably my fault, considering the block worked fine last time I tried (all the way in 2024), perhaps I had forgotten to enable the block? There was some kind of fault with the system I was using to block the site traffic, so... ROBLOX remained accessible, for reasons I might have to investigate later. Fun, what a great way to start off. Failed to properly do my own part.<br>
        It's not a big deal though, anybody could have made this mistake. Most people wouldn't bother to do this either, so I'm kind of alone.</p>
        <p>Plus, I had put it on myself for not doing it to all of my other devices.</p>
        <h2>Complications ("Cold Turkey")</h2>
        <h2>I was the only one doing this</h2>
