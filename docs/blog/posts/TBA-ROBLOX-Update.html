      <!-- Final Title: "Leaving ROBLOX: Relapsed - A 10 day strike"-->
        <p>Before you say that the math is wrong: <b>I quit on the night of May 31st.</b> I couldn't get around to making the post until the 2nd of June, as you're probably thinking. And also, the post didn't get finished until the 5th.</p>
        <h1>We lasted ten days</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, it appears that I am no god. I lasted approximately ten days (roughly May 31st - June 11th) before having my second playsession. The first playsession, being a lag test. The second session has happened today (as of 2:53PM EST) and it seems right now, it's the end of the line for dropping ROBLOX, at least for now. Since "Quitting" doesn't seem to be a fitting name, we're just going to calling it "Striking", since I was more so really aggressive about ROBLOX when I was off the platform.</p>
        <h1>Why did it fail?</h1>
        <p>So we have the main message: <i>The striking failed</i>. But why?</p>
        <p>Well, considering there's multiple point of failures... I can only guess that a multitude of issues contributed to my inability to keep this up. Quitting something so important tends to make it hard. As we all know, tech ethics is hell. Either you have to go out of your way to avoid everything convenient or accept that you will have to compromise on a bunch of companies who will, well, take your blood and wipe their corkboards with it.</p>
        <p>Let's look at some stuff that probably contributed to my eventual coming back. There's no shame in it -- just that we tried our hardest.</p>
        <h2>Failure to properly block access</h2>
        <p>I'm mentioning this right out of the gate, because it's a huge problem that caused the spiral.</p>
        <p>I had told my friend group (the first to know I quit) that I had blocked access to roblox.com in my main computer. Unfortunately... The block did nothing. I didn't do it correctly, it seemed, so it ended up leading to me visiting the site every once and a while to check in on things. And then I caved.</p>
        <p>This one was probably my fault, considering the block worked fine last time I tried (all the way in 2024), perhaps I had forgotten to enable the block? There was some kind of fault with the system I was using to block the site traffic, so... ROBLOX remained accessible, for reasons I might have to investigate later. Fun, what a great way to start off. Failed to properly do my own part.<br>
        It's not a big deal though, anybody could have made this mistake. Most people wouldn't bother to do this either, so I'm kind of alone.</p>
        <p>Plus, I had put it on myself for not doing it to all of my other devices.</p>
        <h2>Complications ("Cold Turkey")</h2>
        <p>This was coming.</p>
        <p>"Sometimes it's hard to quit cold turkey", an expression I had only heard about within 5 days of my strike. And that kind of thing really set in stone how cooked I was from the start. It's hard to quit something you're so accommodated to.</p>
        <p>This kind of fits with the points of "ROBLOX is too popular to drop easily" and "I'm alone in my journey to do something so bold", but this point is different too. When you turn to a game so frequently, it tends to become an old favorite. And old favorites are comfort games for a lot.<br>
        And it was hard to quit a cold turkey. Or however that expression goes.</p>
        <p>Point is, committment is hard. I was trying to distance from a game that gave me comfort because the kind of people who were on the platform were making me uncomfortable. And when trying to not hear about it, I heard about it more, and that spiralled in...</p>
        <p>Well, toxicity. And then it was just downhill from there. And then I tried to quit, it failed... Here we are.</p>
        <h2>I was the only one doing this</h2>
        <p>While not really seeming like a big deal, this was actually a really huge reason. When your friends are all on the same social media, and are very frequent on that social media, it becomes hard to drop that social media.<br>
        It is ten times worse when that is the only place you can reach them.</p>
        <p>In my case, I was pretty lucky. I already knew my friends on other platforms, so I could definitely reach them. But considering that ROBLOX was a frequent gaming choice for a lot of my friend groups, and was a part of a lot of my friends' average game session every day, this was just bound to go down.</p>
        <p>It's something I like to call the "Modern Social Media" problem. When you hook everybody on one thing, have nobody getting word loud enough to introduce everybody else to a perfect, hassle free alternative, have all the bigger alternatives to have a caveat or unintroduced feature of some kind, etc... You create a monopoly.<br>
          So when everybody wants to quit, there are no reasonable alternatives. It's either too complicated (a hassle for users who only used it casually), too basic, or not viable.<br><br>
        The modern Social Media problem.</p>
        <p>The same logic applies here, but specifically the fact that it's hard to leave. Because it's the same problem, just not the same circumstances. This is a video game. Video games tend to leave you coming back again and again.</p>
        <h2>ROBLOX is Popular</h2>
        <p>This was bound to happen too. ROBLOX is a very big game, full of people of various backgrounds, skill levels, languages... So good luck quitting something with a super diverse userbase!</p>
