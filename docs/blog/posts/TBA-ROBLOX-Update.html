      <!-- Final Title: "Leaving ROBLOX: Relapsed - A 10 day strike"-->
        <p>Before you say that the math is wrong: <b>I quit on the night of May 31st.</b> I couldn't get around to making the post until the 2nd of June, as you're probably thinking. And also, the post didn't get finished until the 5th.</p>
        <h1>We lasted ten days</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, it appears that I am no god. I lasted approximately ten days (roughly May 31st - June 11th) before having my second playsession. The first playsession, being a lag test. The second session has happened today (as of 2:53PM EST) and it seems right now, it's the end of the line for dropping ROBLOX, at least for now. Since "Quitting" doesn't seem to be a fitting name, we're just going to calling it "Striking", since I was more so really aggressive about ROBLOX when I was off the platform.</p>
        <h1>Why did it fail?</h1>
        <p>So we have the main message: <i>The striking failed</i>. But why?</p>
        <p>Well, considering there's multiple point of failures... I can only guess that a multitude of issues contributed to my inability to keep this up. Quitting something so important tends to make it hard. As we all know, tech ethics is hell. Either you have to go out of your way to avoid everything convenient or accept that you will have to compromise on a bunch of companies who will, well, take your blood and wipe their corkboards with it.</p>
