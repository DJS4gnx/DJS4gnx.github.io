      <p>Let's cook some anger again, my drive died today. I killed it by forcing my computer off.<br>
    If this was the part I was posting to reddit, this is probably the part where I'd say the drive was in perfect condition and nothing was wrong with it as I purposefully omit out the details!</p>
    <p>No. I'm going to be real, the poor thing probably was looking to leave this planet. Some details I can recall about the drive before it failed is that the near the end of it's lifespan it struggled with moving files a lot, it apparently reached a temperature high of 62 degrees Celcius (my specific drive's operating temperature was 60, allegedly), sometimes foobar2000 media encodes would slow to a crawl of 0.00x speed, my drive was very poorly organized, I never monitored my temperatures, didn't buy a cooler for my drive...<br>
    <br>And all of that on a drive with a terrible plastic enclosure.<br>
  It was found to fall and die.</p>
  <p>Lesson learnt... Do not be reckless with your hard drives, monitor them often. I just raw dogged that drive without any colling, while it sat in a shitty, no-cooling enviornment and ate shit... That was absolutely my fault.</p>
  <p>But that makes you have to care a lot about what you do with your device. Because they're so fragile that even a single swipe would kill it. That's important when it might be the only one you get at all, and that your life depends on it.</p>
  <p>Well fuck...</p>
