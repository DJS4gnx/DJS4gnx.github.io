      <p>Well, everybody here is making a lot of these. I guess this is my chance to say that I will (not) miss 2024! Happy new years for everybody celebrating, and as for everybody else, we'll see you another day!<br><br>
        
        Okay, that's enough for those just casually browsing. This is probably not going to be my last blog, I'll probably remember some random idea I had. (clickbait, ooh!!!)<br><br>
        
        God, 2024 was such a mess of the year. There was a lot of highs and a lot, LOOOT of lows. From what arguably happened here to the bullshit people went through to the more introspective parts of my life. Ugly things happen here on SpaceHey. Lots of ugly things happened in my own life. I'm not going to miss this year.<br><br>
        
        But this year is also golden in a few ways. Lots of great music came out, lots of people had great achivements this year. I think this year I finally got myself exposed to a lot of cool things I never knew of otherwise, like Discord's PresenceDB utility, as well as some other utilities I wasn't already using! It's been a great year for those and especially artists, since we had releases like the likes of Tyler's "Chromakopia", Simon Curtis' "8-Bit Heart" remaster, a bunch of cool FEMTANYL stuff, and yes, Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us"... Arguably there's also been a lot of mid and even bad garbage like Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre's album, Kanye and Ty Dolla's "Vultures 1" and even "Vultures 2", and arguably, J. Cole's mixtape... But lots of developments were made.<br><br>
        
        I guess I made developments too. At the beginning of the year I was making the normal, experimental and goofy stuff, ended up later on making stuff with melodies based on Beethoven's stuff, and now it's almost the end of the year and I've heavily leaned on that "recreating melodies" style. Because it's what I like, a lot of what the people around me like, and a lot of what people resonate with.<br><br>
        
        We made good and bad memories too, yes. But we made memories. Memories we'll remember, memories we'll forget. And in the end, we spent our year being ourselves and learning more about the things we like and the places we go. At least this year was certainly interesting, and in some ways, even an improvement from the last year.<br><br>
        
        Just hope that the drama finally ends next year.</p>
