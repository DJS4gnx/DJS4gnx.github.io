      <p>Remember when I said I missed a lot of what I got to experience years ago and said it was a whole new story?<br>
        Yeah, that's what this is about.</p>
        
        <p>This is more so a blog I'm choosing to spend wondering about if I'm just going crazy thinking I'm alone for that, so I'd like to this time hear how you feel about this! Maybe this is a known thing.</p>
        
        <p>I have a strong nostalgia bias for what I'm used to. It's strange and I feel a little strong about it, but I think that I'm justified to say that <b>things hit harder when they're gone.</b> That's just what it is, and it's proven time and time again. Sorry if that hit a nerve for anybody.</p>
        
        <p>I find myself missing a lot of friends? Like mostly a mix of who people used to be and who they are. What do I mean? There's some people who disappear and I don't hear from again (who they are) and some people who change for the worst (who they used to be). There's many friends who just never logged on after that last time, especially one person I recall who had to go on a trip and since then, they didn't log in again until it was too late for me to try and get through to them. Honestly, a hacker probably got into their account with how shit ROBLOX's account security is, but it doesn't help that you miss them, really. It just makes you wish they logged on once to get nostalgic and happily moved on.</p>
        
        <p>There's obviously also the other audience. Sometimes it's not all bad, there's just people who lose interests you shared with them and they kind of just... change. Many people I used to know through Roleplay simply just stopped and persued other things. Maybe they gave up on their OCs and wanted to be fresh. Maybe they didn't want to RP altogether because they grew up and thought it was "cringe". Or maybe they found a new obsession. That's great, good for them! But I miss those times that used to be there, before everything changed. <br><br>
            
            And I think about that time to time again, because some people leave a huge impact on you. Many of the people I met 5 years ago made an impact on me because they inspired me to continue creating stories and writing my own world. But I miss being so involved with great people and being able to be excited to get on with somebody about a roleplay that I just find myself wishing that excitement existed. I kind of use writing as an outlet for this, writing old lore stories that reflect on the experiences I made. I'm not even going to lie, I reference old friends a lot. Because I recognize I remember them and I wish them well. Because I recognize they've probably moved on and I might not come across them again.<br><br>
            
            I just miss a lot of the people I used to know. They left great impacts on me, and even the people who I still have contact with. Especially some of the people who are still around and even though they've maybe gotten jobs that made them busy or just have other things to persue, I'm glad they're around and still well. <small>Thank you specifically, Ro. Glad you're still well :)<br>
            </small></p>
            
            <p>I just miss having fun like that, I guess. I was an embarassing fool, but a good kind. I got to talk to people and I made friends that I just lost or don't have anymore, be it because I was acting like a dumb 13 year old, or I was just being strange as fuck.</p>
            
            <p>I just think a lot about the past and wish I could meet old faces to talk one more time. Even if it's to apologize.<br>
                Am I alone in thinking like this?</p>
