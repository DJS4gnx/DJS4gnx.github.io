      <h1>Jericho's Tavern: Internetting with Dj</h1>
      
      <p>Hi, welcome to the Tavern! This is my personal blog where I document cool things I can remember and some journeys of mine on the internet. I mostly document my life here and where things have gone, but sometimes I'll also ramble about a cool topic I'm passionate about!<br>
      This page will mirror with my <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/djsng">spacehey blog</a> as much as possible.</p>
      <p>Some of these posts are archives, so keep that in mind! I'll have the source listed if I'm backporting a topic.<br>I hope you have a good time!</p>
      <p>Alt text heavy blog, by the way! Some links have alt text, so hover over links for context! Inspiration for this decision was mostly inspired by xkcd.</p>
