            <p>i just learned that you can hide post content behind a read more, like this:</p>
            <details class="readmore">
                <summary>read more</summary>
                <img src="images/photo3.png" alt="pastille sweeping" loading="lazy">
                <p>nothing to see here!</p>

        nami's comment: you don't have to add the tag links at the bottom of the post for it to show up in the tag filters! as long as you remember to put the tag id in the article class
        dj: okay i think this shows how to do a lazy post. noted...
