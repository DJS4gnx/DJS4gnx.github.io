            <p>ROBLOX is an unmoderated sex ring. There is no explanation how things have gotten so god damn bad, the only explanation is that it is a sex ring with the included challenge of bypassing chat filters. You cannot tell me ROBLOX is not a sex ring because they fail to moderate pedophiles and rapists 24/7.</p>

            <p>i just remembered when i said at some point around december 2024 or early 2025 (probably janurary or feburary if i had to be real) that i wanted to make one of my new year goals to be to work on my friendships and make old remedies.</p>

                <summary>read more</summary>
                <p>the first person i did that with, i dropped. and since then i've done some risky shit and tried to talk to people i shouldn't have, but i'm way better than i was when i knew some really bad people around 2022-2024!</p>
            <p>i'm making progress, i think... this is such a silly goal, trying to make amends with people. even if all i can do is just say "hi my apologies for being unnecessarily rude to you". gosh...</p>
            <p>oh yeah! if there's ever a tw, it'll be just before you click that read more button next time!</p>

        nami's comment: you don't have to add the tag links at the bottom of the post for it to show up in the tag filters! as long as you remember to put the tag id in the article class
        dj: okay i think this shows how to do a lazy post. noted...
