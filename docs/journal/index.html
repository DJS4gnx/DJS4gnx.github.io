            <p>i cannot stop thinking about a startup roblox group tried to approach me to produce for their game in summer 2023, it was a roblox backrooms thing and i think they didnt even have game prototypes yet! i made some demos, they ghosted me, and i can only assume they went defunct because i cannot find any trace of their game anywhere</p>

            <p>following up on when i posted i was anxious about using other people's fursonas and furry art as an icon -- i'm noticing a pattern of "go ahead but only my characters! please do not use a comm that's kinda disrespectful" and i still want to be safe, but my gut is basically slowly getting confirmed, i guess? still worried to do it all willy nilly, i'm always going to check in and hunt an artist's twitter page to get answers on that</p>
            <p>and still fuck pinterest. i can't tell what's commissions, what's okay art and what's outright a disallowed reupload</p>

            <p>trying to repair old friendships i made shit mistakes on... i feel like such a fool. i've dropped people for the pettiest reasons, sometimes in the influence of others i was around. i dropped a dude because somebody was gen appalled on some guy's take and instead of kindly and very clearly explain why people feel a certain way, i blocked the dude. it was a sensitive topic too so i know quite a few people would have been on my friend's side, not his. fuuuck...</p>
            <p>but i do also know that on the other side of the spectrum, i will probably try and make amends and somehow get frustrated by something else or something. i hate friendships so much they're so hard PLEASE PUT ME ON AUTOPILOT. i don't want to worry about offensive content anymore just let me yap about my music pleasee</p>
            <p>i'm a victim of lonely desperation. ama!</p>

            <p>so hesitant to use other people's furry art as my profile icon a lot of the times because i don't want to cross an artist's boundaries but i also have no idea if they would care about me using their fanart or anything as a profile picture. i blame pinterest for making it so unclear</p>
            <p>i do know that some people who make games like nami are so cool abt it because it's a game character and even some fursona owners dont mind as long as u avoid commissions (which i get -- a commissioner would flip their shit if u dont ask) but i don't want to have to overstep the boundary in the first place because i might be hard to reach or sumn</p>
            <p>and pinterest people start crediting art more often. y'all make these issues 10x worse</p>

                <p>I unfortunately cannot sugarcoat it anymore. ROBLOX is becoming a sex ring. "Moderated" is a very light term, because despite the fact I hear almost nothing about the worst of the worst, I still have to hear about how condos are still up, people are having "studio sessions", I have to see day by day avatars of people who very clearly have no pants on, people with display names that are very clearly sexual, and as I attempt to report these things, nothing happens.</p></details></details>
                <p>This is all getting super ridiculous. So it seems that in the meantime, we have to... well... Quit again.</p>
                <p>Yay...</p>

            <p>i just remembered when i said at some point around december 2024 or early 2025 (probably janurary or feburary if i had to be real) that i wanted to make one of my new year goals to be to work on my friendships and make old remedies.</p>

            <p>i'm making progress, i think... this is such a silly goal, trying to make amends with people. even if all i can do is just say "hi my apologies for being unnecessarily rude to you". gosh...</p>

            <p>As celebration for having this little tumblr thing up and running, here's a little demo I wanted to share!</p>
            <p>All I need to do is find a snippet of code that makes a nice looking audio player, rather than just the browser's default...</p>

        <!--each post should use the "article" element. set its class to "post", and add any tags that you use with spaces separating them. this is how it knows which posts to filter when you click the buttons above!-->

        i moved a bunch of stuff into comments for reference stuff. because i don't need the guide stuff until later!

            <p>i just learned that you can hide post content behind a read more, like this:</p>
            <details class="readmore">
                <summary>read more</summary>
                <img src="images/photo3.png" alt="pastille sweeping" loading="lazy">
                <p>nothing to see here!</p>
            </details>

        nami's comment: you don't have to add the tag links at the bottom of the post for it to show up in the tag filters! as long as you remember to put the tag id in the article class
        dj: okay i think this shows how to do a lazy post. noted...
