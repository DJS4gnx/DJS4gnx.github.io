                <p>This is a raw, plain, uncooked website for you to mess with and make your own. It started as a version of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cadars/john-doe/">this template</a>
 but I've overhauled and pretty thoroughly stripped it down; both in 
order to make the filesize smaller (barely over 20 kilobytes!) and to 
make it a little less intimidating if you have zero HTML knowledge. It's
 open-source, public domain, and totally free to modify and 
redistribute.</p>

                <p>Instead of one HTML file per page, this site is a 
single document that uses  anchor links to show or hide different 
sections. It's made entirely out of plain old hypertext — no Javascript,
 no databases, no problems. That makes it load all at once, which can be
 helpful for users on bad or temporary connections. It also makes it 
much easier to edit and publish. The <span class="mono">:target</span> selector is <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target">an old standard</a> that works on all browsers &amp; devices. You can even refresh, use the back button, etcetera.</p>
                <p>I've also marked up the code to try and make it 
easier to understand by taking apart. It's not a complete guide to web 
design by any means, but I think it'll be a fun introduction if (like 
me) you enjoy learning by screwing around.</p>
                <h3>What For?</h3>
                <p>Whatever you want! Start a blog, or a <a href="https://nownownow.com/">"now" page</a>,
 or share your art, or write down some thoughts. Link to some stuff you 
like or pages your friends made. Imagine an internet where the things 
you make and say can live somewhere that belongs to you instead of a 
billion-dollar app. Imagine an internet populated by more and smaller 
and weirder websites that you can explore and discover at your leisure.</p>

                <h3>Format testing</h3>
                <p>SORRY TO INTERRUPT TEMPLATE TESTER I NEED TO INSERT MY WIDGETS AND SEE HOW THIS OLD SHIT WORKS</p>
                <div id="statuscafe"><div id="statuscafe-username"></div><div id="statuscafe-content"></div></div><script src="https://status.cafe/current-status.js?name=kam106" defer></script> <!-- Status Cafe --><br>

            </section>
            <!--HOW TO USE-->
            <section id="use">
                <h2>How to Use</h2>
                <p>Crack open this HTML file in a code editor (I happen to like <a target="_blank" href="https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>, but you can use plain old Notepad if you want.)</p>
                <h3>Under the Hood</h3>
                <p>At the top is some technical stuff, then some embedding stuff like <span class="mono">meta-og-title</span>
 and etcetera. These are pieces that will show up in the embed card when
 you link to this site on Bluesky or Discord or somewhere. You can 
include an image too, but you don't need to use any of this chunk if you
 don't want. (<a target="_blank" href="https://ogp.me/">More info on meta tags</a>)</p>
                <p>Then you'll see the <span class="mono">&lt;style&gt;</span>
 section. This is where the CSS lives and gives the website its visual 
style. CSS is capable of a lot of crazy tricks (especially if you want 
to avoid learning Javascript), but it's also pretty easy to figure out. I
 love and highly recommend the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">Mozilla CSS guide</a> for learning what you can do.</p>
                <p>The HTML content is cut up into <span class="mono">&lt;section&gt;</span>s, each of which has an ID. This is how this website manages multiple pages, by using the <span class="mono">:target</span>
 selector and "anchor links," which are links to a specific element on a
 page instead of a different page. Otherwise the HTML in here is pretty 
basic—just headers and paragraphs and links—so it should be pretty 
simple to figure out, especially if you've ever inspected element on 
Wikipedia to get a fake screenshot for a gag.</p>
                <p>You can embed images and stuff with <span class="mono">img</span>
 tags and a URL, either to an image in the same folder as this HTML file
 or to an external host like imgur. It's good manners to use <span class="mono">loading=lazy</span> on images, especially if they're not on the homepage so they're not visible right away.</p>
                <div class="inline">
                    <img loading="lazy" src="index_files/JFe3Ii3.jpeg" alt="A photo of the ocean on a clear day.">
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Landscape_photography#/media/File:Cape_Perpetua_at_Oregon_Coast_6.jpg">Photo: Jeff Hollett / Wikimedia / CC BY-SA 4.0</a></p>
                    <!--I definitely could make images + captions contained this way without the extra div (to save a little typing if I was making a page with a ton of them) but this is fine + gives you more options for styling them as a unit.-->
                </div>
                <h3>Stealing Rocks</h3>
                <p>HTML, like all programming, is a process of pasting 
other people's code you find on forums into your own project until it 
does what you want. A lot of places (Youtube, etc.) will even give you 
embeddable HTML you can plop right into your own site. Check this out:</p>
                <div class="inline">
                    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 300px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1518073511/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless="" f0l24w3yr="">&lt;a href="https://disasteradio.bandcamp.com/album/buy-now-deluxe-edition"&gt;BUY NOW (Deluxe Edition) by Eyeliner&lt;/a&gt;</iframe>
                    <!--you can't do much to an iframe (embedded piece of a different site) for security reasons but you can apply a class to make it a certain size, etc.-->
                </div>
                <p>Anyway. I'm not going to write a whole "Learning 
Basic HTML" guide in here. Just mess around with it and see what breaks.
 HTML elements are nested boxes and they have IDs or classes (or are 
just standard types of thing) that get referred to in the CSS and 
painted according to those rules. If you're smart you can use 
combinations of classes to make writing and typesetting content easy for
 yourself. Or if you're like me you can slap together some big mess that
 gives you a headache to edit every time.</p>

            <section id="publish">
                <h2>How to Publish</h2>
                <h3>Uploading</h3>
                <p>Getting your site public is easier and cheaper than ever. A really popular option these days is <a target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>,
 which is pretty easy to use and well-documented. They offer a paid plan
 with extra storage and some other neat features, but you can make 
something totally fleshed-out with the couple gigabytes you get for 
free. Neocities also has an in-browser HTML editor and file manager, 
which is so sick when you upload a page and realize there's a typo in 
it.</p>
                <p>If you want to set out on your own, I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>
 for all my sites. Netlify is a little intimidating because it's meant 
for businesses, so it'll show you a bunch of popups about A/B testing 
and node functions and other nerd stuff. But that also means it's free 
to use as a regular person, so I just ignore all those and drag &amp; 
drop my little folders.</p>
                <p>Netlify also lets you upload a text file of automatic
 redirects, which I think is pretty slick compared to using Linktree or 
whatever—you can go to <a target="_blank" href="https://jackis.online/videos">jackis.online/videos</a> to get straight to my Youtube, for example.
                </p><p>Anyway, using either of these services is pretty 
straightforward, especially for a one-file site like this one. Just 
rename it to <span class="mono">index.html</span>, upload it, and you're rolling.</p>
                <h3>Getting a Domain</h3>
                <p>Getting a custom domain name is optional, but I think it's cool. It does cost some money, depending where you buy it (I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>), but if you buy a <a target="_blank" href="https://purpletoilet.com/">goofy domain nobody else wants</a> you're only gonna be looking at five or ten bucks a year.</p>
                <p>To hook up a vanity URL to your site, you'll have to 
do some stuff with DNS records. This process is different for every 
domain broker and hosting platform, so just look for the instructions on
 the service you chose. I believe in you.</p>

                <h2>Bonus</h2>
                <p>I know I just said I'm not writing a whole guide to HTML, but here are a few tricks and tools I've found useful:</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer's CSS reset</a>
 is a sheet that will reset all the weird annoying default properties 
some HTML elements have. Keep in mind that stylesheets are applied in 
the order they're linked.</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://grid.layoutit.com/">LayoutIt</a>
 is a great tool for making CSS grids and flexboxes and stuff. I love a 
CSS grid but remembering all the right syntax is a pain. So just use 
this.</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cssmatic.com/">CSSmatic</a> has some nice generators for things like gradients and shadows, which are also annoying to try and make by typing code.</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> has a ton of open-source typefaces that are really easy to embed and use on your webpage. Some of them are even good!</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a>
 is a tool for compressing images, which is handy if you're hosting them
 yourself somewhere like Neocities with a storage cap. Or you could go 
old-school:</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/">Dither Me This</a> is for dithering images, which compresses them way more and looks cooler than JPEG compression. <a target="_blank" href="https://ditherit.com/">Dither It!</a> is a similar tool that gives you more options.</p>
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>It's good manners to include <span class="mono">target="_blank"</span> on links to an external site. This makes the link open in a new tab.</p>
                <p>CSS has a lot of features meant to make your site more accessible. Use them! Images have an <span class="mono">alt=""</span> tag for description text. <span class="mono">@media</span> queries can check a user's preferences for contrast and input device.</p>
                <p>Margin goes outside of a box. Padding goes between 
the box and its contents. Temporarily giving an element a bright 
background color or border can help you figure out where its edges are.</p>
                <p>Some special characters (&lt; and &gt;, etc.) need to
 be typed in HTML as something else or the computer will choke on them. 
For example, &amp; is encoded as <span class="mono">&amp;amp;</span>. This is dumb but what are you gonna do.</p>
                <p>An <span class="mono">em</span> is a unit about the 
size of a capital X in regular body text. It's good to use ems instead 
of pixels for sizing &amp; moving things so they look right on more 
screens.</p>
                <p>The most important tip is to have fun :)</p>

                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>This one-page style of website does allow you to have
 sections that don't appear in the nav, since you choose what to type up
 there. But it's still all visible in the source, so it's a bad hiding 
place.</p>
