        <p>i'm literally tired of sugarcoating it because there's faults on all ends.<br>let's talk about how companies are not your friend! a scitzo rant from yours truly<br><br>
            talking about the browser industry: <i>nothing is free</i>. it feels like every company and developer in this field is the center of controversy and either you have to settle with half broken garbage or everybody else settles with an option that's more supported but is always missing something the other option has (looking at chrome users here.), always. no exceptions.<br><br>
            
            both parties are at fault too. in the chromium family:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>google chrome is the "vanilla" flavor of browsers. it's basic, fuelled a lot of web nightmares / issues (CEF, webviews, hell even fucking electron, WITH NO SINGLE CORE SUPPORT. PLEASE STOP MAKING MY LIFE WORSE.), has a web store that other chromium based browsers basically surround like a celebrity, and is a data collecting hivemind. and last i checked, it's very possible this is the #1 used browser.</li>
                <li>chromium (the browser, not the engine) is just a reskin of google chrome. ungoogled chromium falls under this category except it trades tracking people for the potential of breaking a lot of google based logins. (at least it seems like it would, when you forcefully disable google like that, but you get what you get, yeah?)</li>
                <li>thorium is based on google chrome and is supposedly faster, but the dev inserted very not E for everyone graphics into the browser</li>
                <li>edge is microsoft owned (yes, i'm dogging on it for that. microsoft is a horrible company) and usually runs like dogshit on low end devices (from personal experience, any hdd equipped or low cpu power device is a nightmare with edge)</li>
                <li>brave has been the center of crypto scandals ("being able to disable them" doesn't work enough because i hate looking at it altogether. it's not togglable on iOS and i don't have the patience to go see if it's on android too, i'm assuming it is!) and has literally affliciate hijacked, a practice honey has done as well</li>
                <li>opera is run by a company that has finance scams under their belt, of all things. based on what they claim, they are the last company i trust, but their userbase seems to have mostly people who either ignore it or happily ride the train that the company has set, even if the dock has shit on it</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div>there are some exceptions to the above, ungoogled chromium has it's reasons and vivaldi, despite some flaws, isn't too bad of a choice, but the thing is a lot of these browsers have morale issues when you use them. but i guess morality went out of fashion a long time ago when it came to install numbers.<br></div>
            
            <div><br>chromium itself has huge implied issues. if an extension is new and the developer is fresh, it's almost guarenteed they'll publish to the chromium webstore first. and from there, it's a gamble if they'll also put it on firefox. sometimes you'll get it after a several month/year wait, sometimes they'll think firefox is outdated by 12 years and they'll just say no.<br><br>
                
                this also works in the opposite direction, firefox extensions most of the time don't get ported to chrome due to limitations/interests and when an alternative extension finally comes along to replicate it, it's always flawed in some way. sidebery is firefox only, yeah? the chrome equivalents don't mount to the side of the browser like firefox does. at most you get a popup when you click the extension button, and i find even if i click through, when i open a tab, <b>THE EXTENSION MENU CLOSES.</b>
                
                <br><br>also, the experience is not the same with vivaldi vertical tabs, i knew that was coming. if you haven't used sidebery before, you can put folders in folders. kind of like this:<br><br>
                
                <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/zjh0dc.png" alt=""><br><br>
                
                on a lot of sidebery clones for chrome, you can do this, but the thing is that it's not native in the browser, it's an extension. and vertical tabs in a lot of browsers don't allow you to group tabs together like this.<br><br>
                
                in vivaldi's vertical tabs, you can folder together tabs. only <i>one</i> layer down. you cannot do it more than one layer unlike above (where i have two layers) because i guess the general public doesn't need it? sure, i'll gladly go fuck myself since my wants and needs do not match the general public<br><br><br>
                
                
                firefox is not really any biblical angel, by the way. it's not a golden savior that came to save me, it's only slightly better than chromium. starting off, mozilla is also the butt of a lot of controversy. it's almost like no company in the tech industry is your friend!<br><br>
                
                that aside, there is forks and that makes that part exempt. people made their own versions of firefox, mozilla doesn't run it, TOS problem gone. but there's another problem! yup, extension parity.<br><br>
                
                reminder that earlier when i was talking about the chrome web store, i said firefox extensions sometimes don't move to chrome. and you guessed it, that means firefox extensions i clutch on do not make it to chrome most of the time! good luck fixing the power dynamic then when you don't have a dark reader, sidebery, or a useragent switcher. <small>if these in fact made it to chrome please correct me, i wrote this having not used chrome in like 3 years<br></small><br>
                
                and again as i said before, sidebery clones on chrome are ass. native vertical tabs suck and don't work like it does with sidebery.</div><div><br></div><div>
                    
                    not to mention firefox uses like a shit ton of ram??? comparing firefox to chrome is a joke because chrome is supposedly the "ram eater", yet firefox nearly maxes my memory out when i open it. 7 gigabytes is nothing but even other browsers have at least optimized shit properly?<br><br>
                    <hr><br>
                    ignoring the fact we talked about browsers, the entire tech industry is at fault. nobody is your friend in the modern day. enshittification is happening around us, companies make products worse and don't shrink the cost. we've seen it already with "shrinkflation", where companies just put less food in your bag and charge the same. but this can be applied outside of that, because we're actively paying the same for worse quality.<br><br>
                    
                    you don't even have to pay to get ripped off because you already get ripped off for completely free! every day we touch websites, right? social media? every day, those sites get worse while we continue using them.<br>
                    actually, twitter is a perfect example of this! look past 2020. the site became a shithole when elon bought it, yeah? so all the people out of the closet (and trolls who knew "x" was going to die fast) left to bluesky, and nothing but brainrot, heavy politics and you guessed it, company update accounts remained! legacy tweets stay on a platform where you cannot even view a tweet logged out. what a great company to put my trust and all of my time in!<br><br>if you play roblox, you can also technically apply this here. i'm not even going to tell you how bad it gets because everybody knows by now. we're in the stock market era, roblox is super distant, their support is ass and hell, the issue with the extensions situation is why i'm ranting. their extensions are all over the place because maybe only 4 good extensions made their way to firefox while every other roblox extension on earth has happily planted their foot in chrome's web store.</div></p>
