       <h1>In 5 Days</h1>
       <p>Hi, just giving an update after I boldly claimed on SpaceHey five days ago that I was leaving ROBLOX due to it's terrible moderation and everybody's lack of actions on it. I thought it was time for a more personal entry rather than the typical informational/ranty stuff I do. A life update!</p>
       <p>So what's new? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdt3d1JcJOo" title="Eugh, second mention... Sexual topics warning.">ROBLOX let another predator free</a>, out of all people, <a href="youtube.com/watch?v=vlKn96ASfcc" title="It's almost like you should boycott them too.">Phoenix is talking about the YouTube crisis</a>, an interesting <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/10954757589" title="Seriously. I went searching for stuff to mention and this game is impressive.">horror game with Resident Evil 7 assets</a> got traction, games about job applications go around, <a href="www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1l1rxu0/roblox_just_added_rotation_for_" title="posted by the official jailbreak developer. Yes, I'm serious.">rotating skyboxes...</a> I should be more negative. Okay, botted platform game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1l41keu/this_happened_on_saturday_from_grow_a_garden_116m/" title="Great game, ROBLOX.">reaches over 11 million people at once</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1l10td6/public_bathroom_simulator_is_officially_closed/" title="The link name is very misleading, so I'll explain it here in a way that's not clickbait: Public Bathroom Simulator shut down. This is a good thing, but the fact it was super late and the developer did it before ROBLOX says everything you need to know.">troublesome video game</a> closes, but not fast enough, "hugging games" not taken down yet...</p>
       <p>That's a depressing update. Let's talk a bit more positive.</p>
       <h1>The Actual Update</h1>
       <p>Out of all the times I actually wanted to look at ROBLOX... I only looked once, which was today. I looked to see if anybody came to harass me, as a paranoid check, and everything seemed clear. I'm going to hope that's the only time I check.<br>
    Additionally, I just found out today that the internet block I put on ROBLOX isn't actually working? I guess it will remain accessible. Fuck.</p>
    <p>As was expected, I am the only one actually going forth with this, but I honestly expected this. This is tech ethic stuff. Not many people will act for the sake of tech ethics, because just so many companies fuck with ethics. Some things just don't change.</p>
    <p>The regret hasn't kicked in yet, that'll probably kick in later on in the month. My current goal is to quit until the end of June, where there should be an update on the ROBLOX Subpoena. My original plan was to wait out the Subpoena and see if the Florida government finally does something, but in the meantime, I've lost hope. This is ROBLOX. THey'll get away with anything at this point.<br>
    So instead, I'm testing until the end of June. If I want to go back by the end of June, I don't really have a choice. I might just end up being another cog in the machine for just a while. It's self explanitory when you remember the modern social media problem of "All my friends are on this, they don't seem to be leaving any time soon, so I guess I have to get on it". It's a hell. It's just one of those ways I'll <i>have</i> to connect with friends. That's all the platform ever became helpful for after long enough.<br>
Fuck, all ROBLOX had to do was get their shit together...</p>
<p>Some stuff to keep me occupied in the meantime seems to be holding me still for now. ULTRAKILL was one of my addictive video games I loved, so ULTRAKILL has kind of replaced ROBLOX as the "pop in until you get numb" game. I got a physical Wii with my sibling's help, so I have that set up and homebrewed too. Just need to pick up accessories, because we don't have a Nunchuck. It's locking us all out of the best games :(</p>
<p>Deltarune 3+4 came out too. There will be that to occupy me. I'm actually most excited about Deltarune, because it's been years since we had another Deltarune chapter. <small>That's it? That's all I can come up with? Okay, brain.</small></p>
<h1>Alone in the World</h1>
<p>It unfortunately seems I'm the only one willing to fight like this. I had tried to explained my reasonings to a friend, but I kind of ran myself in circles trying to explain to them how I'm quitting because nobody else will, and I'm just tired of hearing people say there's no hope, so it's time to just quit and let ourselves get whipped over this.<br>
I miscommunciated and accidently put myself in a feedback loop. My logic hit me in the face because I accidently forgot to explain it in a way that didn't sound like it was the same problem (that you could just "quit" this protest too because there's not enough people doing it at once). That was on me, I'm a very rusty communicator.</p>
<p>So it seems I'll be alone for a while. Hoping for the best.</p>
<p>I will be especially alone knowing some people won't realize the people they're talking to are fuelling this problem. I know what I had to do.</p>
