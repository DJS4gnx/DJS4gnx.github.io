      <p>It has been a while since I had made a good yap blog. From my official blog page being abandoned since I don't use GitHub for much other than reporting issues, to briefly losing interest in SpaceHey because of it's semi-dead nature. I say <i>Semi</i> because a lot of users still happily post. I just haven't found the right friends yet, I think.</p>
