      <!-- final blog post title: "Leaving ROBLOX: Reasons, Problems, What Now?" -->
      <p>In the wise (paraphrased) words of <a href="https://spacehey.com/profile?id=3172535">another SpaceHey friend</a>, "It is, indeed, that bad". <small>the full quote is "when in reality", but shortening it gets the point across. this isn't bending words, right? right??? i didn't do something distasteful???</small></p>
      <p>This blog post assumes you are aware of the controversies of Public UGC, the increasingly controversial types of games appearing on ROBLOX, and flaws in the userbase. If you do not know what that means, it isn't a terrible idea to sit this one out.</p>
      <p><b>This post is not targetted. All mentioned people are anonymous and not identified. Do not harass any of the kinds of people I talk about, people have their lives and reasons.</b></p>
      <h1>Change is Hard</h1>
      <p>Things with companies have been, and will likely always be very, <i>very</i> bad. Being a tech ethic is really difficult right now, because basically every corporation is trying to fuck you over, one way or another. My friend Kie from earlier made a SpaceHey bulletin about it already, explaining really accurately how when you complain about a company or criticize their ethics, somebody will always pop in to say it's "not that bad". It is that bad. Nobody just understands that to their fullest yet.</p>
      <p>When I responded to Kie's bulletin, I chimed in saying that I rely on these services too, and some people may not have the energy to switch, cannot be assed to find an alternative, or maybe don't have that time. There's valid reasons for people being "lazy", sometimes inexperience or only surface level knowledge. (i.e: only knowing about Twitter and not BlueSky, the old twitter revived "community", etc) I also mentioned that it's extremely difficult to quit something you rely on, like Apple making their phones really easy to use to make another phone look impossible to daily drive. I mentioned my stepfather's inability to use an Android after using an iPhone for about a few years, and used that to say that not everybody can make that switch like I can. <small>Some context: I explained in my comment that I used an Android to send texts and do some sideloading/piracy stuff, and that my iPhone was my spare iPhone for 2FA and "doing stuff with". That still applies, by the way, Kie.</small></p>
      <p>My goal was to say that it's hard to quit these kind of things when you're used to the convenience. Other options will either not fulfill your needs or you'll just relapse and go back. My mom quit Amazon because it got expensive, yet she still relies on Amazon for ordering (and now uses TEMU more, I think). I also mentioned that games are removing Linux support, forcing you into Windows, which as we all know, despite <a href="https://djs4gnx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-03-08-Technology-is-Like-Magic.html" title="I know this blog is from 2023, but it still sums up some of it's cool designs and backwards compatibility. Read it!">it's neat parts</a>, is infamously known to be <a href="https://djs4gnx.github.io/blog/posts/2024-10-06-A-Windows-Rant.html" title="Seriously. Microsoft is not your savior.">dogshit,</a> <a href="https://djs4gnx.github.io/blog/posts/2025-04-06-Tech-World-Mess.html" title="When you care a lot about why your computer runs like shit, and you have to sit around watching a circle many days, you tend to want to optimize everything else around it. And this hell happens.">forcing your hand</a> and making you turn to crazy, barely effective solutions. And once you get used to it, <a href="https://djs4gnx.github.io/blog/posts/2025-04-26-Fuck-Companies-1.html" title="Only very loosely related, so sorry for the random drop, but basically the point was that it'll create a turmoil of frustration in everything else.">will drag on you</a>, forever. And then there's no way back.</p>
      <p>I mentioned about it being hopeless sometimes, talked about Google Mail having a huge monopoly in email services... I mentioned another company there.</p>
      <h1>ROBLOX.</h1>
      <p>ROBLOX is a platform I've been on for 11 years. If it was some kind of veteran trying to nostalgia bait kids, maybe I'd say right here I'm 28 and that 2014 when I joined was amazing with no online daters, no outright ToS-breaking games, no dirty things to corrupt kids! It was such a great place, Tix were amazing and nothing ever went wrong...</p>
      <h2>It wasn't perfect then either</h2>
      <p>No, I'm just kidding. 2014 was not perfect, considering the Twitch incident where an admin got on and ranted about ROBLOX's shitty management, Boys and Girls Dance Club being a few years away from getting out the gate, near zero coverage on the kind of inappropiate content roaming ROBLOX, online daters being around even back then, a time of the internet where you could STILL get doxxed like you do now, and considering Tickets put a hole in ROBLOX's pockets... The Old ROBLOX then wasn't really perfect. That's going to apply to a lot of things, as people have talked about on SpaceHey: MySpace wasn't very perfect either, people were homophobic like it was nobody's business. Idealizing it is kind of like idealizating a life that's actually worse than you make it out to people. People struggle a lot for many reasons, idealizing them because they have a special right kind of objectizes that kind of living. And you also look like an asshole.</p>
      <p>But note that I said 'could still get doxxed'. Because for many people, that wasn't really noticable. You had to hunt or go out of your way to somehow find certain content, and when it came to games like Boys and Girls Dance Club, it was a lot of imagination to understand 'oh, that's a bad thing, this shouldn't be on a kids game', because at the time, this stuff was just harder to find. Of course, it was always around, but the distinction I'm trying to make is that it was harder to find it then. It's plentiful and even in your face now.<br>
    Moving on, we offtracked.</p>
      <h2>Easier to associate, harder to realize</h2>
      <p>That was ~2014-2016 I was talking about, a huge target to nostalgia bait. I brought that up for obvious reasons, 2016-2018 is said to be the peak of ROBLOX. I'd argue that 2018 started a subtle downfall (Boys and Girls Dance Club on ROBLOX Today), 2020 set the stones (Public Stock, existance of modern-ish cons), and since ~2023-2024, it's started it's fall (Public UGC, con epidemic). ROBLOX never had a perfect track record, but I'd like to argue that there's been an INSANE all time low. I'm not one to talk, I've pretty much praised 2014 all the time. But I'm not doing that because it was <i>perfect</i>, reminder. I kind of do that because I miss being oblivious to the dangers around me. Life kind of revolves around being oblivious to stuff going on around you, you forget the things going on in the world and you have some fun with your friends. But then that creates the problem of "ignoring the real world", which is a whole new thing. It's a balance of being happy and being aware, pretty much.</p>
      <p>It's a lot easier to enjoy something and be happy attached to it when you cannot <b>see</b> the shit going around. You know how investors are unaware to the bullshit on the platform? That's because they are detatched from the community, they just care about the numbers going up. In a similar (but not exact) way, I feel that way about old ROBLOX. Yes, it wasn't exactly perfect... Considering what I've mentioned before, and considering my comparison is not exactly top material (comparing myself to an investor is a HORRIBLE idea, but you get it, I'm sure), but it kind of makes sense. You're just a child. How are you supposed to recognize what's good and bad? For those reasons, you tend to associate those times with good memories, completely forgetting about the bad that year. And that's kind of how I feel.</p>
      <p>Plus, the feeling of community has always kept me biased. This is not exactly a fact I'm boasting all the time, but I was in the roleplay community between 2019 and 2023. 2019 is a year I'm super biased about, because along with the roleplay game I was on, the active, tight knit community that surrounded it at the time and my own positive memories, I've associated that with good times. Again, it was hard to see the bad because I was absorbed in something that I liked a lot. And that tinted the glasses.</p>
      <p>And it worked. Because I couldn't see the controversies going on around me. All I cared about is that I was super social, making friends, and I had discovered a new hobby! Unfortunately... I think it's come to haunt me now, because we're, well...</p>
      <h1>Bleeding Fists</h1>
      <p>Here... Fuck.</p>
      <p>ROBLOX right now, is a predatory hellscape. You cannot forget a problem and ignore the bad when it's actively harder and harder to avoid the bad. Factors like my friends playing publically (high risk of coming across a bad actor), my previous experience with being cyberstalked, ROBLOX actively doing fuck all to these issues... I cannot put it any family friendly way, because the family friendly aspects of the platform died when the invesators came by. It's a very doomer mindset, I know, but I am literally tired of sugarcoating it. ROBLOX as a company is incompetent with their moderation (reference not intended) and people who LITERALLY DANCE IN FRONT OF KIDS IN OUTFITS THAT SHOULD BE ARRESTABLE WALK FREE. What do people like me get? A one day ban for 'spam', deleting whole ass accounts via ban enforcement for trying to play, JUST FOR BEING ON THE SAME IP ADDRESS, etc. Well that's sure helpful, having to worry I'll get banned because my sibling got banned. Watching my alt accounts all get deleted? Great! Even better!</p>
      <p>If I was not bound by SpaceHey's restrictions on being asked to "keep it family friendly", I would have just said all of this as it is. But I want to keep it clean so I can post this in the first place, so I've watered everything down. Just know that if I ever get moderator permission to use suggestive terms (I will not attach images or links. I'll explain what I want to explain -- how ROBLOX is bad right now, but I won't take it any farther), I will follow this up and edit in all the things I want to say. At the end, probably.<br>Anyways, the amount of rings of problematic people that are on ROBLOX IN PLAY DAY, the people who exist just to piss people off and disturb kids, the UGC scape that makes me physically want to act out towards people who play ROBLOX to expose kids to things they shouldn't be seeing, the moderators who do jack shit about this epidemic of malice, the toxic people on ROBLOX's community that get to tell literal kids to ""wash them"", Moderation for Dummies becoming defunct around this March over Discord, the moderator reading over Ruben Sim's account seemingly stopping, creators consistently reuploading games that were previously banned with near zero repercussions, influencers who are allowed to influence and manipulate people for at least a year before having action taken against them, ROBLOX unbanning the accounts of people whose reputation very appropiate plummetted, two people in Florida getting arrested trying to meet a kid they met through ROBLOX, Discord having double standards by keeping inappropiate servers up while banning a bot to stop that problem, AI dependant moderation...</p>
      <p>You see the problem yet, yes? The fact I could list all of that, in one virtual breath, is insane. The very FIRST thing should have been where the list stopped, much less STARTING at it. Better yet -- stalking! I've been cyberstalked over ROBLOX, for fucks sake! Said stalker is probably reading this, now!</p>
      <p>Sorry, carried away there. Point is, hate. I have a new found Hate for ROBLOX. It was culminating since 2023, starting as a subtle paranoria from the interactions I had over ROBLOX. After the effects of Public UGC 2024, it slowly began to get worse, and by 2025...</p>
      <h1>Quitting</h1>
      <p>Yeah, exactly. I've given up on ROBLOX and lost all hopes on it ever getting better. Let's have a serious talk for a moment, without the joking "what is wrong with you", without the teasing "this must be totally okay".</p>
      <h2>Bad Actors</h2>
      <p>I'm putting this in first, because this is around when somebody probably would have lost interest. I am a yap machine, after all.</p>
      <p>ROBLOX is not lacking in bad actors. At all. The amount of people who are exposing children to content that should be limited to adult ranges says it all, although there's definitely more examples. A lot of controversy comes on ROBLOX, being a platform on the Internet, however it's still a crazy amount of drama. Take in for example, I was in the ROLEPLAYING community. I played a very dying game that, by the time I was losing interest in it, was filled with near nothing but bad people running around. ROBLOX's moderation action? Near nonexistant. I'm not kidding, there were people who were constantly breaking ROBLOX's rules, including, but <i>definitely worse than</i> bypassing filters to swear on a kids game.</p>
      <p>And I know this, because I was stalked by one of these people. I'm not exactly comfortable sharing more, and considering we're keeping it clean here, I'm not giving any details either. But just know that some stuff happened and I had a target on my back for backing out of a friend group more than once. And now I carry that paranoria everywhere.</p>
      <p>But that never really stopped there, either. Creators, developers, innocent people, all always in drama of some kind. Somebody's always ending up as a shitty person every second week, and it's no surprise anymore. People creating bad games have an ego problem like Kanye West, being super violent towards anybody trying to stop them and antagonizing others trying to do the right thing and take down inappropiate games on a kids game. Why? Because ROBLOX has enabled this. It's obvious.</p>
      <p>These people are basically cut and dry on ROBLOX. This will apply to any platform, but again, it's gotten so bad on ROBLOX that it's almost like a hub for it if you know where to go. It's bad, man.</p>
      <h2>The "Kanye West" Analogy</h2>
      <p>I've mentioned this before in my SpaceHey bulletin: Think about Kanye West. A man that did things people adored, and while constantly making an ass out of himself because of his ego problem, he still made music people related to. He pushed boundaries to push, and made crazy things. He got insensitive over a South Park joke about mishearing Fishsticks, stood up at the VMAs and shit talked the trophy winner...<br>Then he stopped being good because he got a "hyperfixation" about the early 1940s.</p>
      <p>Kanye's reputation fell off so hard because he did stupid shit like this, and ROBLOX is not really an exception. They made edits to their platform that caused huge issues and they actively do nothing but silence people for it. Yes, <i>silence</i> people. See Ruben Sim, the many people who get warns for aggro on these people...</p>
      <h2>The big problem</h2>
      <p>I've said enough over the past few times, but ROBLOX has a serious problem that's slowly being enabled day by day. Bad actors exposing children to things their parents should gatekeep. Nothing more needs to be said, ROBLOX moderators need to get a grip and get their thumb out of theirs.</p>
      <p>I won't yap much here because I've said it a thousand times, but it is bad. Every second server, you will see it. Just trust me. Play Natural Disaster Survival, Work at a Pizza Place, anything popular... You will see it. It is specially bad if it's R15 enabled. Now go on your little hunt, but be careful!</p>
      <h1>Hesitance</h1>
      <p>The core is here.</p>
      <p>It's hard to quit something you care about. This will probably be the biggest reason here why I'm choosing to step back, but just know that Bad Actors and "The Big Problem" are both contributors too. This is just a huge thing holding me back.</p>
      <p>I am reliant on ROBLOX for some of my hobbies. While I could probably go searching for new games to play, that solves the problem of being so attached to the content I like on ROBLOX such as the unique games on it, yes, but the really big underlying problem is that my hobbies either started at or was advanced by ROBLOX. ROBLOX evolved me as a person. It's hard to let go of something that helps make you, well... your very own person. My roleplaying passions were started by ROBLOX, my music hobby is assisted by ROBLOX Studio, the character creasion I work with was in part, enabled by ROBLOX... It's hard to quit things you become attached to. Especially things that become a part of your everyday life.</p>
      <p>It's easy to just find stuff on the ROBLOX Catalog to dress a character, layer by layer. Having a visual reference of the character, being able to scale items in a 3D space is just something that helps a lot with Character Creation. Making Portraits with screenshots, making edits using ROBLOX footage, and making album art with Studio renders are all things I'm going to miss a lot. I do know this is what I have to do, so I guess I still have to go through with it, but a huge stepping stone has been shot by doing this big task of just quitting.</p>
      <p>And that creates hesitance, because it's hard to quit something. I'm doing something ambitious, maybe very dumb.</p>
      <h1>Different than Social Media</h1>
      <p>Okay, so I quit TikTok a long time ago. I've been clean from TikTok a good while, I haven't ever doomscrolled in a while, at most maybe doomscrolled to find a YouTube video to put in the background. Maybe Doomscrolled Pinterest for that perfect profile picture -- Pinterest did that, and I need a new place to get profile pictures. That's a post for another Blog.</p>
      <p>But the thing is, TikTok is a social media platform. It was easy to just stop picking up TikTok because I only connected to it when I was in the bathroom or something. It was a pick up thing about mindlessly watching videos, that was easy to quit because the toxic people and the little to no benefits of keeping it around made it very easy to justify quitting. It's a second wind now.</p>
      <p>ROBLOX is a whole game. It's tools shaped me as a person and gave me an identity, especially helped a lot of my hobbies. Throwing away a tool I actively use is hard when you're attached to just what shaped you... ESPECIALLY something you've used for a long time. It's not easy to replace something, especially something as big as ROBLOX with so many uses. I'd have to find a replacement for each and every purpose, which is often easier said than done. You have to find a way to get more edit clips of my OCs <small>good fucking luck! I don't draw, animators already get tired a lot, I'm too broke to hire anybody</small>, create art without actually drawing using rendering <small>I don't want to learn Blender... So that already takes out 50% of my options</small>, create characters visually without drawing <small>I heard Picrew was great for this so I will be looking into that, but for that ROBLOX style, I'm pretty fucked. Revivals are dead. That's already all of my go-to</small>, roleplay <small>Discord techincally replaces this, but finding partners who are patient and not judgemental can be hard</small>, and artwork creation <small>again, not using blender, that's 50% of my options. photography, maybe, but i take blurry photos a lot</small>. No sane man has time for all of that. The average person would go "Okay, maybe we should go back" and end it there. But not me.</p>
      <h1>A hate so cold...</h1>
      <p>Talking about how I feel this strongly might be a huge help alone. So let's start there.</p>
      <p>On the night of the 31st of May (2025), I went into a research rabbit hole trying to find a place to report people that is more effective than ROBLOX's report system. I searched for Moderation for Dummies, places to send these creepy people right to Ruben Sim himself. Over the minutes, I just got darker and darker as I noticed the moderator that reviewed Ruben was gone, Moderation for Dummies' discord server shut down with Ro-Cleaner got banned in March, and having to be exposed to actual proof of game creators fuelling this epidemic... The full chat messages...</p>
      <p>And the Twitter profile was last active in Janurary. So there was no help from them either.</p>
      <p>I made a very sporatic decision to quit then and there. I had saw in a quick summary, along with a real screenshot of a bunch of users grabbed from a ROBLOX Underground "Ring" group of a bunch of users in very gross outfits, all from investigating a SINGLE user with a similar outfit. If this was a cartoon, I would have thrown up. I knew then I had to get out of dodge.</p>
      <p>Seeing horror on the screen and being the center of the horror will always be two different things. It's easy to be obsessed with horror and get a thrill from people being unsettled. But being the lonely girl in the dark hallway will always hit you like it hit her over the screen. On it's own, maybe seeing all these weird games wouldn't affect me so hard if it wasn't everywhere, in your face, among all the other throwaway games that are as badly made. <b>It becomes a whole new problem when every second game you play, somebody has a suggestive outfit on.</b></p>
      <p>My eyes might have been opened that night, because the problem had gotten so bad in the coming years, that I've just today processed how bad it is. It must be at least over a million or two people in these outfits. These things have to have high profits, encouraging ROBLOX to not moderate them... All I can really do is imagine how bad it is, because there's nothing else to do. There's no other clear option, when even the moderators won't help you.</p>
      <p>I'm almost convinced people are desentitized to this content for being ROBLOX regulars the way how Americans seem almost desentitized to the idea joking about school shootings just because it happens so much. It's so common, that you have an almost casual reaction compared to the countries (friends?) around you.</p>
      <p>I've literally even seen my own friends interact with these people, for fucks sake. Of course, I don't mean the really bad ones, I would have instantly dropped somebody for obvious reaons <small>Asssociation... Am I thinking about this too deep?</small>. I mean the ones that are very subtle, but not very obvious with it. You know the crop tops with the heart in the middle? Those. I see my friends come across them all the time, one friend actively interacting with these people. I think they're super tired and don't mean to be insensitive, so I won't name drop them, but they have at least once claimed "it isn't that bad, I've seen worse" then openly interacted with these kinds of people. <small>Grab the bucket, we'll throw up together.</small><br>It was even worse when somebody I met over SpaceHey did. That same person, in the bad outfit, proceeded to do the W+S trick, told me very disgusting things and basically ragebaited me. <small>which I fell for... shit.</small> What did my friend do? Play chess with them, and wrote on their iMood that I wouldn't tell them why I'm so mad, when I <small>in reason</small> chose to block them for being very casual with somebody who literally made uncomfortable comments about me. I found that out over Email.<br>Oh, and then they vandalized my shit.</p>
      <h1>The Crossroads</h1>
      <p>Even after all of this, I'm still so conflicted. It's a hard pill to swallow, all of these issues and problems. I think I have the case of blinded by nostalgia, but held back by reality. Nostalgia made it easier to ignore these problems because you had to actually go out of your way to find these things. You'd hear about them, but in regular play, you wouldn't find these kinds of people 24/7, if at all. Plus, I was so much younger, I couldn't put two and two together.
    <br>Now you find them every second server and I cannot justify being on ROBLOX right now. Try it. Go ahead, go on. <small>do it in moderation! take breaks!</small></p>
    <p>Without the attitude though, it's just going to be hard. I have to make the choice between my hobbies and my childhood game... and doing the right thing for ethics. If you asked me to do this when Public UGC first came out, I'd hate to admit that I would said it wasn't that bad. I would have said I just want to play my favorite game in peace, I didn't see nothing wrong. Oh, how I've turned around now, holy shit.</p>
    <p>I never trusted ROBLOX for this reason, they're just not transparent enough, ever. I never gave them my Phone Number for Voice Chat (unlike my friends who have... oh my god, the headache), never gave them my ID (I don't have one, but the point stands -- The things people will give ROBLOX is insane)... Their security has always been terrible, this was no surprise. It's apparently better now than it was when I was last beamed and neary survived in 2020, but I was soft beamed in 2023 by an associate of my stalker. In 2024 it allegedly got better, but I'm still skeptical. They took away parental pins and want to replace it with 2FA -- A system that has been proven countless times that it doesn't work. I had to be either caught by a serious, undisclosed ROBLOX flaw or some kind of cookie beam. If it was a cookie beam, how did they get into my system? Lots of questions to attest to that.</p>
    <p>But it's hard to quit. Everybody plays it, everybody gives them information they shouldn't be trusted with, and it fuelled so many hobbies I love. So that leaves me at a crossroads.</p>
    <p>Abandon a hobby for my ethics and personal reasons? Watch evereybody play anyway and have it slowly eat at my mind?<br>Stay on this platform anyway and be another number on a platform that's unhealthy? Go against what I should do?<br>A compromise?</p>
    <p>It's a hard world out there. Luckily I had made a plan, I'm going to drop ROBLOX for a while, maybe a few weeks. I'm going to pay attention to Florida Subpoening ROBLOX and if they think the platform is safe to be on, then I'm probably taking my permanent leave. But if something improves somehow, even slightly, I might consider going back. As for right now... Goodbye, ROBLOX. Fix your bullshit, goddamnit. Where's your excuse? Not your buggati named Excuse, your <i>excuse</i> for this bullshit.</p>
    <h1>Thanks / Resources</h1>
    <p>Leaving this off with some thanks and resources that helped me out through these times.</p>
    <p>First goes to <a href="https://spacehey.com/profile?id=3172535">Kie</a> over on SpaceHey, I've said before I read their bulletin and while their post wasn't a big inspiration, he put it in many accurate worlds how bad things are with companies. They're seemingly going to work on a blog about tech ethics after their finish their blog about Subcultures, so when that comes out, I'll put it here as a resource.<br>Hi, by the way! Please take inspiration from my post or quote me if it sells your point! Your post on SpaceHey old internet revival was really nice and detailed, I know I was a <i>little</i> passive aggressifve on this post, but if the inspiration or anything helps out, please go ahead and steal!</p>
    <p>Another note goes to <a href="https://xcancel.com/modfordummies">Mod for Dummies</a>, which seemingly went defunct in Janurary 2025. I know Ruben has his sort of controversies. I won't mention them, but a good scroll on the MFD twitter kind of set into realization how bad this problem is. Shame it had to kick in only now, that's been my fault.</p>
    <p>Greenlegocats have been another resources, he was a troller on ROBLOX but since he's been doing cover stories on ROBLOX events and giving commentary, he's been a good resource to. He made a good video about Boys and Girls making it to ROBLOX Today in 2018, among other things. I'm too lazy to link them, but they're good listens.</p>
    <p>Final thank you to anybody I met over ROBLOX or connected with over ROBLOX for a long time, you're all awesome. You know who you are, thank you.</p>
