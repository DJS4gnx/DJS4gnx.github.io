        <p>this is a really wild shot, i expect most of the people around my age on this platform to not know about this game but doesn't hurt to try anyway<br><br>
            
            y'all remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-CGg9z-Ra8" target="_self">pixel warfare</a>?? the unity web game where u played in a minecraft ripoff with guns and y'all shot eachother over dirt and castles and a fucking warehouse??<br>
            the same game nobody remembers and nobody plays the steam remaster because it's ass?<br><br>
            
            how y'all been???? i was a tiny ass child when i played and not even a teen yet, probably shouldn't have been playing it tbh but it was SO FUN, even though i was shit and it was like playing cor5 in 2014-2016<br>
            where we all at?</p>
